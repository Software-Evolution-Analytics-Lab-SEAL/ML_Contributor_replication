1,2,"Remove annoying raise_with_op behaviour, document.",dwf,"This adds a docstring for raise_with_op and also modifies its behaviour
somewhat. Previously, the exception was re-raised with a different
'args' member -- namely, in addition to the exception message it added
two new elements to the tuple: the Op itself and a string telling you
where in the graph the corresponding Apply node appeared.

This gets in the way if you want to have an exception message containing
formatting (newlines and tabs), since the entire tuple is printed, and
the formatting on the string is not rendered.

I've never seen the Apply node index be of use to anyone debugging, but
my proposed solution is to stash that information in `__op_instance__`
and `__applynode_index__` on the object instead of in the args tuple.
I would not be against appending to args[0], the exception message,
with applynode information, but this is easy enough to obtain at the
pdb prompt with my modifications.

```
    callback - a callable object to call after each call to a thunk within

The purpose of such a callback is to inspect the values computed the virtual machine as they are computed, rather than only at the end.  This is especially useful for catching problems that later prevent the VM from reaching the end of the function.

This adds the sparse dot. The difference with the structured_dot are:
1. Support for sparse operands anywhere(Sparse x Dense, Dense x Sparse, Spare x Sparse) whereas structured_dot supports only supports (Sparse x Dense, with DxS supported using transposes).
2. Structured_dot has a special semantic and is not the true dot because it doesn't calculate the gradient wrt to zero elements. Of course in some cases this doesn't matter, but it does sometimes (second layer with sparse hiddens, or sparse weights for ex).
3. Structured_dot will not yield speed-ups when dealing with sparse inputs. The reason is that it doesn't perform the weight update inplace which is very important. I have an Op called Usmm for that. Usmm is the equivalent of Gemm in sparse blas.

144,176,Composite fixes,jaberg,"Chasing a bug on my mac at home, I made changes that I think are improvements to Composite.  The bug I was finding was that on unpickling, from the cache, the Ops didn't match because Composite was testing the hash of a saved cmodule_key.  I was unable to understand the problem, because only the hash of an old cmodule key was still around.

Looking through the code though, I found and fixed a few bugs:
1. the name of composite doesn't identify what it does: {mul,add} could mean (a+(b_c)) or ((a_b)+c)
2. the hashing strategy using the cmodule key is too complicated and I think unreliable. It's not tested and I didn't trust it.  I modified it to use the generated _c_code directly to identify the 'meaning' of the Op. This is still not thoroughly tested, but now at least it's much simpler and easier to debug (no md5 hash of configparser in the __hash__ function).
3. the code generation strategy was potentially wrong. C code and support code was not embedding the name of nodes of self.env. I suspect that in the case of compiling certain nested composite nodes for the GPU, this could cause compilation errors or wrong results, due to name collisions in support code.  It could also cause name collisions in the c code.  It's a lot of work to set up the test to prove that this is the case, and what's there now is certainly at least as correct as what was there before.  Therefore, please accept the pull request without demanding more work from me, debugging these things has already taken for ever.

155,188,Fix failing tests in tensor module,jaberg,"On my machine in FAST_RUN mode, with floatX=float32, the only failures in tensor tests are KnownFailures. I haven't run the tests on GPU.

The main fixes to pay attention to deal with the support code.  There are two methods for returning support_code:
1. Op.c_support_code(self) - returns generic (not node-specific) support code
2. Op.c_support_code_apply(self, node, nodename) - returns node-specific support code

These methods should generally both be used (one does not supersede the other) and the mistake was that Elemwise was not providing both.

There was also a silly error in CeilTester - testing the gradients at points like 2.0, -1.0 and other integers where the ceil function is discontinuous.

188,223,Fix default axis for tensor.roll,dwf,"#221 introduced a convenience function that emulates `numpy.roll` (thanks, @mrocklin) with subtensors and joins, however the default `axis` argument was 0, which deviates from the NumPy behaviour. The default behaviour of NumPy is to first flatten, roll on axis 0 and then reshape back to the original dimensions.

Seeing as deviations from NumPy's behaviour should probably only happen for a very good reason (e.g. casting madness, Theano's desire to be strongly typed), this pull request brings the behaviour into full lock-step with NumPy for tensors with more than one dimension by flattening, making a recursive call to roll, and finally reshaping. It also adds a test for this case.

198,233,Fixed optimization for exp(x) * sigmoid(-x),odelalleau,"This stability optimization didn't work for at least three reasons:
1. It used tensor.neg(x) to identify -x, while in canonicalized form -x
   is written -1 \\* x.
2. There was a typo (calling a function sigm that didn't exist).
3. It wasn't able to parse a tree of multiplications, for instance
   something like (exp(x) \\* 2) \\* sigmoid(-x).

This new version fixes all three issues. In order to solve problem 3,
it uses a different approach that consists in parsing the optimized node
into a so-called ""multiplication tree"".

Currently, the structure of this tree is left unchanged. It would be
possible to have this optimization also flatten the tree, which would
make the code simpler (but potentially undo work performed by some other
optimizations).

NB:
- I verified that all tests pass (except those currently broken by other recent changes)
- This fixes the numerical instability problem in the deep learning tutorials (rbm.py) recently discussed on the theano-dev mailing-list, where NaNs would appear in float32

211,246,Changed default compiledir under Windows,odelalleau,"This change was advocated by Sebastian Urban, who explained:
When you use roaming profiles in a domain environment the contents of
the user profile directory C:\\user\\xxx are transferred (copied) from a
file server at login. Login will become slow when many temporary files
are stored in this directory. Therefore they should be stored in
C:\\user\\xxx\\appdata\\local because this directory is not synchronized
with a file server. theanorc can stay where it is, because it should
roam with the user profile.

This commit actually changes `config.home` rather than
`config.base_compiledir`, because it is likely that if Theano ever wants
to save more data files (in addition to compiled C modules), the same
remark would apply.

At the same time, `config.home` is being changed to be the home
directory for Theano files, rather than the user home directory. It
was not used anywhere in Theano except to define the location of the
compilation directory, so there was no reason to keep a pointer to the
user home directory while moving the Theano compiled files to another
location.

In order for this change to be safe, an error is raised if a user
attempts to redefine `config.home` without also changing the location of
the compilation directory. Otherwise, Theano files would be compiled in
the parent of the intended folder (if the user is not aware of this
change).

Finally, note that currently, having both `config.home` and
`config.base_compiledir` is redundant, since `home` is only used to
define the default value of `base_compiledir`. So we could just decide
to get rid of `home` (this is out of the scope of this pull request though).

- I think that the _minimal_ext_cmd isn't needed, but I left it in.
- Why not do direct substitution into full_version, instead of
  writing code to do Python substitution again? Left it as is for
  now, in case there's a good reason...

serious bug somewhere, like an AssertionError.

286,330,Make platform-dependent compiledir configurable,josharian,"This is a follow-up pull request to gh-320, implementing the suggestion there.

One issue of note encountered during this change: `SafeConfigParser` doesn't like having format strings in its config files (it tries to do substitutions itself and fails). There were a couple of options:
- Put the `compiledir_format` substitution variables into `configparser.py`. Seemed an inappropriate mixing of concerns.
- Delay config file parsing and add a substitution variable registry. Seemed like overkill.
- Parse the file twice, once with `SafeConfigParser`, and once with `RawConfigParser` if that failed. This is the option I went for.

I'm open to feedback, of course.

uint64 for unsigned integers).
The default dtype can be overridden by specifying a dtype manually.
However this does not appear to be very safe, so a warning was added to
the docstrings when doing so.

This commit also contains a few minor PEP8 fixes.

Let's discuss in gh-356 the optimization issues when the user can specify the output dtype.

  the lambda expression

respect to shared variables with updates of the inner function. After
more reflection, I think those numbers I'm computing have no meaning ..

Unless the user asks explicitly for the R_op with respect to some value
that is a shared variable, this would not affect anything (just some extra
computations). The reason I removed them is not only the possible
meaningless of these numbers, but also the fact that R_op methods are not
defined for random number sampling function, which would appear as
shared variable. So you would get that you can not compute the R-op because
some function is not defined for that op, even though that is only to
compute some values you don't care and which might not have any meaning.

I have no idea exactly how to test this, since is not a bug per-se is more
of a semantic error in my understanding of what the R-op is suppose to do.

504,575,"Fix for CUDA 4.1 on OS X, prevent -no_pie flag",gwtaylor,"I updated to CUDA 4.1 today on OSX and found that Theano would no longer compile with nvcc.

I get an error like this:

```
ld: unknown option: -no_pie
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
```

 It turns out that the host linker on Mac 10.7 (and 10.6 I guess, because I haven't upgraded to 10.6) passes the -no_pie option to the linker by default. This is a known issue reported in the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Release notes](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/4_1/rel/toolkit/docs/CUDA_Toolkit_Release_Notes_And_Errata.txt).

Apparently the solution is to pass the option `-Xlinker -pie` to nvcc. This patch does just that (only on the darwin platform and when CUDA version is >= 4.1). 

It would be good if another Mac user (perhaps on a different CUDA version) tries this and makes sure it doesn't break compiling with nvcc.

I think a simpler test can be made that doesn't involve scan, just subtensors, hence I haven't added his example as a test. However a test would still be nice, and I'm going to add one hopefully soon. 

The problmem is when you have subtensors of the form x[slice1, slice2][slice1](i.e. the first subtensor has more slices then the second).

546,627,Fix crash and corruption bug in CSM's grad,ynd,"Fixes 2 related things:
1. A crash bug in CSM's grad when the gradient is sparser than the input. In those cases the data vector of the gradient is smaller than the data vector of the input, and this causes a crash with the current implementation. To be a valid gradient, the data vector should contain zero entries for those who have zero gradient.
2. A corruption bug in the same op. The order of the data vector is not guaranteed in the CSM format (the elements on the sparse axis are allowed to be unsorted), therefore the elements of the data vector in the gradient may be in a slightly different order than in the input. This was causing problems for me by leading to NaNs for example. This happens whenever there is an unsorted sparse matrix somewhere in the graph. This happens for instance when you use advanced indexing on a sparse matrix. In scipy.sparse they solve this by having two versions for the affected ops: one that works when the matrix is sorted, one when it isn't. See https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/sparse/sparsetools/csr.h (csr_binop_csr_canonical and csr_binop_csr_general for instance)

I provide an efficient C implementation for the corrected gradient op, and I provide tests for CSM and it's grad.

Since this is not necessary for theano's main functionality and the names were sometimes wrong, I commented out this section and added a note explaining in what case the logic is wrong. I don't actually know what the correct logic is, so I didn't fix the bug in that section. However, I added functionality to insert the correct name in the grad method itself.

-Modifies theano.function to raise an exception if given a subgraph containing BadGradOp
-Modifies theano.tensor.grad to raise an exception if it tries to return a subgraph containing BadGradOp
-Adds a GradNotImplementedOp and convenience function grad_not_implemented for identifying a gradient as uncomputable due to not being implemented yet
-Adds unit tests for this functionality
-I ran all the unit tests on ceylon and they passed for me

This pull request does NOT do a few things:

742,894,Fix theano.gradient.grad,goodfeli,"Summary edit to reflect changes from code review on August 30 at 12PM EST.

-Updates theano.gradient.grad to correctly discriminate between inputs that are not connected to the cost and inputs that have zero gradient
-Updates theano.gradient.grad to compute only those gradients requested by the user
-Removes the UncomputableOp machinery that was used to hack NaNs into the old grad method
-Introduces NullType, used to represent undefined or unimplemented gradients
-Adds an optional connection_pattern method to the definition of the op contract. Currently this is only used by the shape op, and will probably only be needed extremely rarely in the future.
-Adds more unit tests to make sure gradient.grad works correctly
-Changes one tests to KnownFailureTest. The test asserted that a disconnected input error was raised when one shouldn't be. Later this test can be changed to assert that the grad method does the right thing, but we are still arguing on theano-dev about what the right thing is (0 or NaN) in this case.
-Introduces the connection_pattern method and DisconnectedType

I recommend when reading this pull request you look at the final diff rather than each commit individually. I made several changes in the process of finishing this pull request so several lines in the early commits were later removed.

For now it just enforces one rule, that a comment should start with a space. I hope other people will add more rules later.

757,910,Consistent & correct handling of integers and gradients,goodfeli,"This pull request introduces:
-Documentation of a consistent way of handling gradients and integers
-Type checks that ensure the gradient is always floating point and not an integer
-Type checks that ensure the gradient of an integer is always undefined or 0
-A new unit test checking that the gradient of an autoencoder hidden layer with respect to its input doesn't change if you make the input integer-typed
-An upgraded version of connection_pattern that provides theano with enough information to answer questions like ""is variable x a function of variable y?"" accurately
-Corrections to all tested ops making sure that their gradients handle integers correctly and consistently
-Type checks preventing the grad method from returning None, which in the past could have meant zero, disconnected, or undefined

Some tests are changed:
-Some tests used to enforce incorrect behavior, such as that the gradient with respect to an integer must be 0. These tests have been corrected.
-One KnownFailureTest said that the correct behavior for the test was under debate. The test now enforces the behavior I document in this pull request.
-This pull request exposes a bug in Rop where Rop does not detect an undifferentiable input. One of the Rop tests is now marked as KnownFailure
-One test using the deprecated compile.module functionality is marked as KnownFailure, because getting the test to pass would be labor intensive and I'd prefer to have someone familiar with compile.module port the test to not use deprecated functionality anymore. If it can be translated to use theano.function / theano.shared it should be easy to make it pass.

When reviewing this pull request, I recommend reading the global diff, rather than individual commits. After submitting the pull request I will go through the global diff and add line notes explaining what each section does.

Please hold all comments about PEP8 stuff until all debate about functionality is done with. I'll clean up the PEP8 as a final post-processing step.

Finally, please remember that the purpose of code review is to improve the correctness, readability, efficiency, etc. of the pull request, not to try to veto any pull request that doesn't implement one of your grandiose dreams. Please keep your code review comments focused on whether the pull request leaves the library in a better state than before the pull request.

These optimization can have positive effects in many more cases. There is a memory vs speed exchange going on for some of the optimization, so I've added a new tag ('more_mem') to be able to 
exclude those optimizations that lead to more memory consumption.

760,914,Add sort_apply_nodes function to gof/sched.py,mrocklin,"This adds a new function to sort apply nodes in a graph according to a sequence of arbitrary sorting functions. 

One could (but should not) replace io_toposort with a call like this

```
sort_apply_nodes(inputs, outputs, cmp=[dependence])
```

If you wanted to prefer to schedule GPUOps before CPUOps when possible then you would write the following cmp-function

```
def gpu_first(a, b):
    aval = -1 if isinstance(a.op, GpuOp) else 1
    bval = -1 if isinstance(b.op, GpuOp) else 1
    return cmp(aval, bval)
```

And then call 

```
sort_apply_nodes(inputs, outputs, [dependence, gpu_first])
```

And we get a valid topological sort but with gpu ops coming before cpu ops when possible. 

This does not attempt to replace io_toposort. It is merely a utility function.

This allows theano functions to be used as parts of an MPI communication; it does not make Theano into an MPI controller. In a client/server split this is purely client code.

This used to be marked as Work in Progress (WIP). I have removed this label. I think that this is ready for review and potential merge. 

Here are some open concerns
1. I use os.popen in an test_mpi_roundtrip - is this ok? It may not be cross platform.
2. test_mpi_roundtrip assumes that nosetests are run from the theano root directory - it fails otherwise.
3. For these to work properly we need to be able to specify that wait nodes should be run as late as possible; otherwise this can result in deadlocks
4. I allow the creation of MPI operations even if MPI isn't available on the host computer. You can make graphs but not run them. 

There were some old issues:
1. ~~Some of the optimizations don't like these nodes. I have to use a mode without an optimization to compile without errors~~
2. ~~If you look at theano/tensor/tests/_test_mpi_roundtrip.py I've had to comment out a very slightly more complex test case (look for ""y = x + x"" in the top branch). With this added the computation never finishes. The processes are stuck waiting for each other. This doesn't make sense to me~~ (this is caused by poor ordering by toposort)
3. _test_mpi_roundtrip.py is a simple test. I'm not sure how best to integrate this test into theano's testing framework. In my own code I have a test that calls `os.popen(""mpiexec -np 2 ....."").read() == ""True""``. This works great for me but isn't (I assume) cross platorm. 
4. ~~I would like to support `infer_shape` but some of my variables are not arrays. I've tried returning () for the shape of these variables but the ShapeOptimizer doesn't like this. What is the preferred way to deal with ops that have non-array inputs/outputs?~~
5. ~~Recvs are seen as constants by the constant_folding optimization. This causes compilation to hang.~~

775,935,Mpi,mrocklin,"This adds operations for `MPISend` and `MPIRecv` as well as the associated waiting operations. These are accessible through the functoins `send, recv, isend, irecv`.

This allows theano functions to be used as parts of an MPI communication; it does not make Theano into an MPI controller. In a client/server split this is purely client code.

This used to be marked as Work in Progress (WIP). I have removed this label. I think that this is ready for review and potential merge. 

Here are some open concerns
1. I use os.popen in an test_mpi_roundtrip - is this ok? It may not be cross platform.
2. test_mpi_roundtrip assumes that nosetests are run from the theano root directory - it fails otherwise.
3. I allow the creation of MPI operations even if MPI isn't available on the host computer. You can make graphs but not run them. 

There were some old issues:
1. ~~Some of the optimizations don't like these nodes. I have to use a mode without an optimization to compile without errors~~
2. ~~If you look at theano/tensor/tests/_test_mpi_roundtrip.py I've had to comment out a very slightly more complex test case (look for ""y = x + x"" in the top branch). With this added the computation never finishes. The processes are stuck waiting for each other. This doesn't make sense to me~~ (this is caused by poor ordering by toposort)
3. _test_mpi_roundtrip.py is a simple test. I'm not sure how best to integrate this test into theano's testing framework. In my own code I have a test that calls `os.popen(""mpiexec -np 2 ....."").read() == ""True""``. This works great for me but isn't (I assume) cross platorm. 
4. ~~I would like to support `infer_shape` but some of my variables are not arrays. I've tried returning () for the shape of these variables but the ShapeOptimizer doesn't like this. What is the preferred way to deal with ops that have non-array inputs/outputs?~~
5. ~~Recvs are seen as constants by the constant_folding optimization. This causes compilation to hang.~~
6. ~~For these to work properly we need to be able to specify that wait nodes should be run as late as possible; otherwise this can result in deadlocks~~

TODO
1. Test current implementation
2. ~~Create a local optimization to perform the split~~
3. ~~Create a PyObject to wrap `cudaEvent_t`~~
4. Add more inputs/outputs to Waits/Sends to handle garbage collection
5. ~~Register the optimization correctly~~ (should make an async tag?)
6. ~~Add destructor and reference counting to cudaEvent PyObj~~
7. ~~Remove old sync calls~~
8. ~~Replace sync communication kernel calls with async ones~~

818,986,Ready for merge: Streamline dot & tensordot / Allow dot products of n-dimensional variables,jlowin,"NEWS.txt:
new feature:
- tensor.tensordot now support Rop/Lop (Jeremiah Lowin)
  - This remove the class TensorDot and TensorDotGrad. It is the Dot/Elemwise op that are used.
- tensor.dot support n-dimensional inputs as NumPy (Jeremiah Lowin)
  - Work on the GPU too.

Update 3: Think we're all set here.

Update 2:
As described here (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/theano-dev/VL_VTKTeHjw), the most streamlined version of this now has a Dot op supported by two functions, tensor.tensordot and tensor.dot. These two functions handle high dimensional inputs in ways that allow the dot products to be optimized and accelerated.

Update 1:
As described here (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/theano-dev/hSKQaZZOutw), I'm working on streamlining dot/tensordot beyond simply allowing high dimensional dot products. Essentially, all dot/tensordot operations will be expressed as 2D matrix products (unless inputs are both < 2D). This has significant performance gains, unifies gradients/r-ops, and can be run transparently on the gpu without the current tensordot optimization.

Original:
This pull request updates the dot op to allow ""numpy semantics"": passing variables with ndim other than 1 or 2 (including 0-dim scalars).

Note that the perform method is actually unchanged, as it always called numpy.dot -- this pr updates:
- make_node, which previously blocked variables with ndim other than 1 or 2
- grad, which previously only supported vectors and matrices
- infer_shape, which previously only supported vectors and matrices

Additionally, this restores the unit tests for dot products of scalars and tensors, and gradients thereof.

Things to consider:
1. R-ops are still unsupported for ndim > 2 because my implementation of higher dimension gradients uses tensordot, and tensordot does not support R-ops.
2. The gradient is only being tested via ""verify_grad"" -- are there more robust tests to implement?

842,1019,Re-add part of the dtype constraint on out grads,lamblin,"In order to avoid expanding memory usage and computations in the part of
the graph that computes gradients, I propose the following conventions,
that re-instate some of the constraint that existed before on the
dtype of gradients:
- When calling some_op.grad(inputs, output_grads), each variable in the
  ""output_grads"" list, if it is an actual numeric variable (and not,
  for instance, DisconnectedType or NullType), should have the same
  dtype as the corresponding output variable.
- Moreover, if one of the output variables is of a discrete dtype (int
  or uint), then the corresponding output gradient (if not a special
  case like NullType) should be zeros.

This is implemented in theano.grad, so the Op's grad method does not
have to be changed, but now it can rely again on the fact that, if an
output gradient has a dtype, that dtype will be the same as the
corresponding output variable.

859,1042,cutils_ext import fix -- allow theano to run on picloud servers (not CVM),jlowin,"This address issue #728.

When theano is transmitted to picloud, the cutils_ext import fails if the __init__ file isn't available at a certain point. 

All this PR does is make sure the cutils_ext __init__ file exists by touching it. Moving the compiledir to the front of the path (previous solution) was insufficient because without the __init__ file, the ""wrong"" module gets imported anyway (see comments in #728). Otherwise, the existing line 1623 of theano/gof/cmodule (in compile_str), which does exactly the same thing, would have been sufficient.

**NOTE** this doesn't work with the CVM linker. I have tested it with the c|py linker.

875,1068,Fixes several issues with gradients and some other bugs,goodfeli,"This passes the tests on boltzmann. It is ready to merge.

-Fixes violation of op contract and bugs introduced by pull request that put integer gradients back in the library
-Fixes issue where members of consider_constant were treated differently from Constant variables
-Fixes bug where known gradients provided to grad_sources_inputs were overwritten if they were on integer-typed variables
-Gets rid of grad_sources_inputs; it is now implemented via a new known_grads parameter of the grad function
-Removes some broken Lop unit tests

Fixes some bugs that I found while doing the above:
-Partially fixes bug where get_constant_value has no way of reporting a TypeError because TypeError was used to mean ""not constant""
-Fixes bug where Scan assumed all TypeErrors raised by the grad function were due to undefined gradients
-Fixes bug where get_constant_value didn't check whether a subtensor op's indices were constant

887,1083,Full advanced Indexing support + gradient,jsalvatier,"This patch implements full advanced indexing support as well as the gradient. 

It currently relies on this package being installed (https://github.com/jsalvatier/advinc), which only has c function. Obviously this should go in Theano, but it's not clear to me where it should go. I would like some input here.

Also, the patch currently relies on numpy having an interface to MapIter (which is a recent patch), so it's also necessary to check that this works. 

Since the patch isn't strictly ready, I'm not sure if this is the right channel to go through, so let me know.

895,1091,Speed up the gradient of AdvancedSubtensor1 WIP,aboSamoor,"This is a PR to address the issues explained in [theano-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/theano-users/z2YJFo6ciXo) and touches on https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/930

The solution that I propose is that `AdvancedSubtensor1` gradient return a sparse matrix instead of dense one or make that an option.

The first solution I tried was to convert
`W = W - 0.1 * grad(J, W)`
to 
`AdvancedIncSubtensor1(W, 0.1 *gz, inplace=True)`

This proved to be hard to implement. Optimizing the whole graph with global optimization for the `AdvancedIncSubtensor1` is a hard to implement, as the graph get more complicated with various clones and several apply nodes separating the target from the sources of its inputs, detecting patterns  becomes so brittle. I think similar issues appeared with `Subtensor` gradient optimizations.

Returning a sparse matrix will allow us to avoid any global graph optimizations needed as the operations that require dense operations will be replaced with their corresponding sparse ones. Therefore, complexity goes down from theta(W) to theta(non-zero elements in grad(J, W)). Now, sparse formats have different performance characteristics. For now, I am returning csc matrix as it works best for me.

I added a new operation that converts gx, idx to a sparse matrix. It is called ConstructSparse.

One issue that appeared and was not expected, that AddSD does not have an inpalce version. Which forces us to create a whole new copy of the dense matrix. Therefore, I added an inplace version to the python implementation. Moreover, to boost performance I implemented both inplace no-in-inplace in C. To enable inplace optimization, I added local optimization to the theano/sparse/opt.py.

I understand that my PR is quite not-quality. This is a hackish solution that fixes my problem by making my code run in constant speed regardless of the size of W. Moreover, I achieve 4x speedup on small matrices. Therefore, it is a win-win fix.

However, I would like to hear your concerns and requests to improve the patch so it is easy to merge back to theano.

Finally, I would like to thank Pascal Lamblin, John Salvatier, Ian Goodfellow and  Frédéric Bastien for their help and continuous support.

2) fixes an issue where grad is non-deterministic
3) the Updates class was not appropriate for representing updates because it is non-deterministic; replaced it with the OrderedUpdates class. This requires changing scan to use the new class.

Also adds some features I found useful for debugging these issues.

I'm actually surprised that it's possible for the node not to have any client: could it be a sign of a bug somewhere else? Or is it expected in intermediate graphs during optimization?

Consider the following code:

``` python
from theano import function, tensor as T

ZZ = T.repeat(T.zeros((1,)), 2, axis=0)
f = function([], ZZ)
```

It complains during constant folding with:

```
TypeError: ('Non-unit value on shape on a broadcastable dimension.', (2,), (True,))

932,1139,Add sort method and tensor.argsort function,jlowin,"As discussed on the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/theano-dev/B9DNiC15Jtc

The implementation of sort and argsort is inconsistent -- sort is a function (called as theano.tensor.sort) but not a method; argsort is a method (called as matrix().argsort) but not a function. If Theano is to follow NumPy's example, both sort and argsort should be callable as either a function or a method.

Part of the confusion is that the docstring for matrix().argsort says to refer to theano.tensor.sort.argsort, but because the function ""sort"" is imported in the theano.tensor namespace from the ""theano.tensor.sort"" module, the module is shadowed and argsort is unavailable.

956,1178,Fix bugs reported by the DL tutorial wrote by Nicolas,pascanur,"There are 2 bugs: 
 (1) Connection pattern bug:
  The logic in the connection pattern should be : if out1 is an input to out2, and x is an input to out1 then x is an input of out2
   The implementation used to be : if out1 is an input to out2 and x is an input to out2 then x is an input of out1, which is wrong

 (2) Push dot optimization 
 For the optimization to work, one  of the inputs of the pattern has to be a sequence. The bug happened when both inputs where sequences, because I had to if/else branches and in the first if I checked if input 1 is a sequence and arrange the code according,  in the second if I checked first if input 2 is a sequence. When both where sequences, I do the first steps considering input 1 the sequence, and then the rest of the steps considering input 2 sequence .. which results in the wrong shapes. 

Ideally one would implement this as a special case on its own, that avoids the scan.

[Theano Performance] : GPUAdvancedIncSubtensor1 seems to be pretty slow on the GPU

In the case when x and y have exactly the same dimension and we are not setting (and only incrementing), the following loop is implemented in C:
            if y.ndim == x.ndim:
                assert len(y) == len(idx)
                for (j, i) in enumerate(idx):
                    x[i] += y[j]

We use the already available APi's: CudaNdarraySubscript and CudaNdArray_inplace_add

Subsequent optimizations can be made incrementally.

1045,1282,Initial version of the compatibility guide.,abalkin,"@delallea> I was wondering, do you think you could write a short documentation on coding guidelines (both Python & C) to make it less likely for future development to break Python 3 compatibility?

I am submitting a very preliminary version of the guide mostly to establish the right place and format for it.  I don't think we need a Py3k only guide.  IMO, maintaining compatibility with 2.4 is much harder these days than compatibility between 2.7 and 3.2.  I intend to make this guide a one-stop reference for all backward and forward compatibility issues.

[Theano Performance] : GPUAdvancedIncSubtensor1 seems to be pretty slow on the GPU

In the case when x and y have exactly the same dimension and we are not setting (and only incrementing), the following loop is implemented in C:
if y.ndim == x.ndim:
assert len(y) == len(idx)
for (j, i) in enumerate(idx):
x[i] += y[j]

We use the already available APi's: CudaNdarraySubscript and CudaNdArray_inplace_add

Subsequent optimizations can be made incrementally.

1069,1316,WIP:Speeding up GpuAdvancedIncSubTensor1 by writing fast Cuda Code,viveksck,"NEWS.txt:
- Faster GpuAdvancedIncSubtensor1 on Fermi GPU and up on matrix. (Vivek Kulkarni)

This commit does the following:
1. It speeds up the implementation of GpuAdvancedIncSubTensor1 by implementing a fast CUDA kernel:
It finds all the rows which needs to be incremented and increments each cell of the row in parallel on GPU.

```
This is a big win. We get a very good speed up as you can see below
This assumes that atomicAdd is supported on the GPU
```

Baseline: Time per call to GpuAdvancedIncSubtensor1 : 7.30e-02s
98.3% 98.3% 146.042s 146.042s 7.30e-02s 2000 2 2

With optimization (time per call to GpuAdvancedIncSubTensor1):6.87e-04s
36.2% 36.2% 1.375s 1.375s 6.87e-04s \\* 2000 2 2

In the next phase of the optimization, I will make a graph optimization which completely makes all GpuAdvancedIncSubtensor1 operations inplace at the cost of a few GpuAlloc.

The reason was that large parts of the graph were reachable via multiple paths and thus where traversed again and again, without producing any new findings. The attached pull request makes the traversal routines visit each node at most once, cutting down the computation time from >80 minutes to 2 seconds in my case without changing the result.

1125,1397,FIX: Do not explicitly link against libpython2.x on OS X.,rkern,"On OS X, for both framework and non-framework builds of Python, the correct way to link extension modules is to use the link flag `-undefined dynamic_lookup` instead of specifying `-framework Python` or `-lpython2.x`. With either of the latter, it is very easy to accidentally link against Python distributions that are on the system but are not the Python being used to build Theano. This is a _very_ common case on OS X since Python is provided by the OS, but users should be using third party builds of Python.

I believe this addresses issue #1319. I have not been able to test how this affects GPU-using extension modules with nvcc, so I would appreciate if someone else could test that.

1129,1403,Py3k Fixes Bugfixes,HapeMask,"It appears that I had some files installed from fixes that got wiped out before being committed. I tested the new python 3 compatibility by pulling and building on my home machine (which was not used to develop the changes) and saw that these commits were missing from #1398.

The Travis-CI tests passed for #1398 because it looks like they only run against python 2.5.

The theano-nose script does not run under python 3 because it uses files in the source tree instead of the build directory. The source contains files that get fixed up with 2to3, but the fixes don't appear until the files are moved to the build dir.

I ran the tests manually on my own machine by cd'ing to the build/lib/theano directory and running nosetests3. After many passes and some familiar looking optimization failures, the tests segfaulted so I can't see what went wrong.

This may merit an issue of its own since I'm not immediately sure what's wrong with the py3 tests.

These commits do allow me to run a clean install of theano with python3 though.

Now there is only one test failure remaining: the reverse_dict test. It appears that the order of elements in the reversed dict values is not deterministic.

Here are two runs of a [test script](http://pastebin.com/NfmYWSdP):

``` bash
[~]$ python test.py
{1: ('a',), 2: ('a', 'b'), 3: ('b',)}

False
```

You can see that the values in the list for key 2 are reversed. The cause of the issue can be found here: http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__

In python 3.3, the version I'm running, hash randomization is enabled by default. This won't be a problem for python <= 3.2 and I'm not sure how much of an issue this is anyway as the meaning of the reversed dict seems to still be correct.

All the commit above this one are stuff to help debug it!

@pascanur, can you review the change to scan? Also, should we do a similar fix to the line above? @lamblin suggested to replace the line above by:

```
outer_inp_seqs += [x[::-1][:scan_node.inputs[0]] for x in self.outer_mitsot_outs(outs)]
```

Runing scan tests with this modification don't raise problem. But I think this just show it is not tested.

NEWS.txt:
- Fix shape crash inserted by Scan optimization. The gradient of some recursive scan was making the PushOutSeqScan optimization insert crash during the execution of a Theano function. (Frédéric B., reported by Hugo Larochelle)

Theano flag:
- Add a new Theano flag: compute_test_value_opt. It take the same value as compute_test_value. It enable compute_test_value during Theano optimization. Only useful to debug Theano optimization. Also small changes to some optimization to work correctly in that setup. (Frederic B.)
- Add the value pdb to the Theano flag: compute_test_value and compute_test_value_opt. (Frederic B.)
- Add the Theano flag: optimizer_verbose. Default False. When True, we print all the optimization being applied.(Frederic B.)

Internal:
- Scan optimization now report as reason the optimization tag (Frederic B.)
  This allow to easily now witch tag to exclude to disable an optimization.
- Scan and elemwise fusion optimizer now register its name as a tag. (Frederic B.)
- In the optimization wrappers in2out and out2in, remove an not needed intermediate wrapper when there is only 1 optimization (Frederic B.)
- Chagen FunctionGraph Features interface of the {on_prune(),on_import()} call back to take a reason. (Frederic B.)

1218,1538,Better error handling and buildbot,nouiz,"The important thing now is that we don't override an error in device_free if there was already a python error. 

This help to see the first error, as in the clean up, the cuda driver sometimes is in a so bad state that cudaFree fail for valid input.

There is also a small thing about the buildbot.

One question, when there is an error, currently, we always cleanup the output of the node, even if the output was preallocated. This is safe, as we can c_sync on the output even if there is a failure. So we could never decref them in the case of error.

This is my first contribution to Theano so please don't hesitate to let me know if there's anything to improve on.

I add openmp to elemwise operation. The case of contiguous tensors is quite simple, but for non contiguous case I had to rearrange the code so that the threads can't update pointers.

I also add a new configuration's variable, that I called openmp_minsize. The openmp is activated only for numpy vectors of ""size"" greater that this value, if openmp is activated.

I made some tests, and with openmp_minsize=200000 I get a 2x speed up for different operations

1383,1755,added consider_constant op,benanne,"This adds the _theano.tensor.consider_constant_ op, which causes the gradient for a given expression to be truncated to 0. It has the same functionality as the _consider_constant_ keyword argument of _theano.tensor.grad_, but it allows for more flexibility. For example, it is possible to use the same subexpression in a given expression multiple times, where the gradient is only backpropagated through some of the instances of the subexpression, but is truncated for other instances (those wrapped with the _consider_constant_ op).

I wasn't sure what module I should put this in, so I went with _theano.tensor.extra_ops_. There is also an optimization that removes the op from the graph to make sure all the right optimizations can be applied. I added a basic docstring and two tests, one that verifies correctness of gradients, and one that verifies that the op is removed from the graph by the optimization.

1387,1759,Speed up matVecModM function.,MarcCote,"I'm using a lot of random streams like `uniform(...,nstreams=100000)` and as I increase the number of `nstreams`, the compilation time was also increasing. So, I took a look around and found the initialization part of the MRG_RandomStreams uses the `matVecModM` function a lot.

What I found is the following line will always be positive (for explanation see below), which means the if-else is wasting cpu time:
https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/sandbox/rng_mrg.py#L35

I got a 2x speed up when removing the if-else. But, I though it could be faster if we could remove those two for loops. I used some numpy magic and now, on my computer it is 3.2x faster.

The reason line 35 will always produce positive number has to do with the modulo operator: `x1 % x2 == x1 - floor(x1 / x2) * x2` (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mod.html) So, as long as the divider (`x2` in the example, or `m` in the `matVecModM` function) is positive (which is the case in ours), the remainder will be positive.

That being said, since we are casting the remainder as a int32, the only way `r` could be negative is if the remainder was greater than `2^31-1` before the cast, which is not the case here because `m` is either `2^31-1` or `2^31 - 21069`.

1427,1809,Release GIL while waiting for the GPU,f0k,"This PR adds a new config flag `theano.config.gpu.release_gil`. If set to `True` (default is `False`), theano will release the GIL when calling a blocking CUDA call to allow other Python threads to do some work in the meantime.

Background information: Theano does all its transfers and computation on the _default stream_. Kernel calls (including CUBLAS functions) are asynchronous on the host, that is, they return immediately. They are synchronous on the device, that is, they are executed in the order they have been submitted, one after the other. Transfers are synchronous on the host and the device -- that is, they are scheduled for execution on the default stream, and they return only after all previously scheduled computations (not only on the default stream, but also on all other streams on the device, that's what's special about the default stream) and the transfer itself have finished. Thus, every `cudaMemcpy()`, `cublasGetVector()` and `cublasSetVector()` is a good place to release the GIL. Furthermore, there are some explicit synchronization calls `cudaThreadSynchronize()` which also wait for all scheduled computations to finish. (By the way, `cudaThreadSynchronize()` is [deprecated](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__THREAD__DEPRECATED.html#group__CUDART__THREAD__DEPRECATED_1g6e0c5163e6f959b56b6ae2eaa8483576), but that's another issue). We also release the GIL in these occasions.

As we started to discuss on [theano-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/theano-dev/CbX0XuUQmG8/mDA7m64OSwkJ), there may be a way to implement this without changing the flag causing a recompilation of all the code. Let us continue the discussion here and see if to merge the PR as it is or amend it.

1435,1822,[WIP] Albatros: CPU/GPU shared variable #130,nicholas-leonard,"fixes #130 

Right now I am trying to debug my fix to work with the theano/tensor/tests/test_sharedvar.py unit tests. Have some topo errors that I don't really understand:

For this PR:
- [x] Fix don't change the shared var outside type during execution
- [ ] Use an internal variable with a type different then the outside variable type. Here we can force all Theano function to use the same internal type for a given shared variable. That way, we don't need to do automatic transfer between CPU and GPU.
- [ ] Add tests that check pickling/unpickling with changing GPU availability.
- [ ] don't have strange dependency on cuda in tensor

For another PR:
- [ ] support new GPU back-end
- [ ] Figure out how to have the shared variable be considered on different device in different Theano function.

1501,1904,FFT convolution: make optimization support uneven image width,f0k,"Hey,

this is a collection of a few minor fixes/enhancements regarding `conv2d_fft` (by the way, thanks a lot to Sander for starting it and to everybody else involved in making this happen!):
- For me, `nosetests theano/sandbox/cuda/tests/test_fftconv.py` always resulted in a failure because `test_full` happened to be executed before `test_opt_full` or `test_opt_valid`, so `theano.sandbox.cuda.fftconv` hadn't been imported by anybody yet. Fixed by explicitly importing it in the beginning of the file. Let me know if the import needs to be conditional instead and I'll change it.
- It was a bit cumbersome to find out that I don't only need `scikits.cuda`, but even the current development version. Documented that.
- While reading the code, I noticed that `ConvOp` allows an image and filter shape specification with some entries set to `None` to indicate that they are not known at compile time. This is passed on to `GpuConv` in the `local_gpu_conv` optimizer, but `GpuConv` assumed it either had no shape specification or a fully qualified shape specification. Added an extra check where needed.
- When using the `conv_fft_valid` and `conv_fft_full` optimizers on a graph that had convolution input images with uneven image width, it would happily create a graph that doesn't run (i.e., it compiles, but barks when executed). Changed the optimizers to check for uneven image width if the image width was given at compile time, and use the `pad_last_dim` argument to `conv2d_fft()` if needed.

Sorry for putting this in a single pull request, I can split things if needed.

Cheers, Jan

Since we don't even call gpu_init() in that case, the cublas handle never gets initialized.  It split out the testint part in a new gpu_test() function and rewrote the gpu_init() function to always initialize the blas handle.

This is not tested because it is late and I'm tired.  So please test before merging.

I hope this is the end of the troubles with that part.

1596,2033,Faster algorithms and gradients for GpuCorrMM,f0k,"As a follow-up to #2023, this PR adds [caffe's backward pass wrt. inputs](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/conv_layer.cu#L98) to GpuCorrMM to implement `border_mode=""full""`. It passes all the tests and it's about 2-4x faster than simulating a full convolution with a padded valid convolution. On the way, it cleans up the code and adds some more elaborate documentation.

There are some caveats, though, all stemming from the fact that the implementation in caffe is meant as a backward pass for a valid correlation:
- With `border_mode=""valid""`, `GpuCorrMM` doesn't flip the kernels, but with `border_mode=""full""`, it does.
- With `border_mode=""valid""`, `subsampling` is for subsampling the output, but with `border_mode=""full""`, it is for upsampling the input.
- With `border_mode=""valid""`, `pad` is for padding the input, but with `border_mode=""full""`, it is for cropping the output.
- With `border_mode=""full""`, it needs a different memory layout for the kernels.

Currently, `GpuCorrMM` directly wraps the underlying algorithm, and `local_conv_gemm()` copes with the different peculiarities, because I wasn't sure whether the `GpuCorrMM` Op should be inserting dimshuffles, kernel flips and `gpu_contiguous`es on its own.

Looking at the end result, although it's quite fast, `local_conv_gemm()` now basically undoes everything that `ConvOp.grad()` does. It might be possible to write an optimizer that replaces the gradient of a valid convolution with a properly parameterized `GpuCorrMM` Op, instead of just replacing the full convolution Op that is part of the gradient (introducing redundant dimshuffles etc. on the way). This way we would leverage the caffe implementation better.
The alternative would be to modify the CUDA code to perform a subsampled, padded, full correlation, as would be expected from a Gpu Correlation Op. This would be cleaner, but it would also mean a lot more work and we wouldn't profit as much from caffe's implementation for the case of `subsampling != (1,1)` or `padding != (0,0)` (granted, this may be an uninteresting case in practice anyway).
/edit: Another alternative would be splitting this into two Ops: `GpuCorrMM` for valid correlation with padding and subsampling (the caffe forward pass), and `GpuConvMM` for full convolution with upsampling and cropping (the caffe backward pass). This way it would be obvious how the operations differ, but the memory layout required for the second Op would still be unintuitive.
Yet another alternative would be splitting it into `GpuCorrMM` and `GpuCorrMM_gradInput`. This way it would be obvious how to use `GpuCorrMM_gradInput` for computing the gradient of `GpuCorrMM`. We could even add `GpuCorrMM_gradKernel` for the gradient wrt. weights; it seems caffe does things slightly different there as well.
In both cases, `GpuCorrMM` should get a `grad()` method to define its gradient (so it can be used directly in a CNN to avoid kernel flipping and whatnot) and `local_conv_gemm()` should still be able to replace any `GpuConv` instances with a gemm-based Op (so it can be used with existing CNN implementations).

For now, I set the default values for the new parameters of printing.debugprint() and debugmode.debugprint() so that the default behavior is the same as right now (which is printing the inner graphs). This is, however, inconsistent with printing.pydotprint() where the default behavior is to not print the inner graphs.

1634,2103,Propagate shape information to ConvOp gradients,f0k,"Another attempt at closing #2089, as an alternative to #2095.

I just went through `theano/tensor/nnet/conv.py` from top to bottom trying to understand and clean up the shape inference code. Changes are:
- In `has_all_shape()`, `nkern` and `bsize` default to `1` so they can be omitted to just check for completeness of `imshp` and `kshp`.
- `getOutputShape()` supports symbolic shapes and shapes including `None`s. Also it returns a tuple instead of a numpy array.
- `imshp`, `kshp`, `imshp_logical`, `kshp_logical`, `outshp` and `fulloutshp` are guaranteed to be tuples after `__init__()` was called, but can contain `None`s. All the code is adapted to this.

I just tested this with `theano/sandbox/cuda/test_conv_cuda_ndarray.py:test_gemm_grads` and found that I had to disable shape inference (`infer_shape()`) by unconditionally raising a `ShapeError` for it to work. So probably something is wrong, but I cannot look into this today. Regard this as ""under construction"", but let me know if you have any comments.

I didn't want to call it 'same' because it only gives the same output feature map dimensionality if the filter sizes are odd. If they are even, the output feature map dimensionality is one larger than the input.

For example:
input shape (64, 128, 32, 32), filter shape (256, 128, **5**, **5**) will result in an output shape of (64, 256, **32**, **32**)
input shape (64, 128, 32, 32), filter shape (256, 128, **6**, **6**) will result in an output shape of (64, 256, **33**, **33**)

Unfortunately implementing a true 'same' convolution is a bit more involved and the definition is a bit ambiguous.

I also had a look into adding some tests for this, but it seems that tests for convolutions with different border modes are a bit involved, so I haven't attempted this yet. It looks like I'd have to add a `_test_half` function in `test_conv_cuda_ndarray.py`?

1678,2182,Add a mechanism to use more than one (gpu) context in a single theano function,abergeron,"**Disclaimer:** This is work in progress.  Some changes made here will cause a lot of code to not work anymore, so don't use this branch unless you are prepared to deal with that.

This add some optional methods on Ops that will trigger CLinker to pass a context argument that will be available at init and runtime.  This context is typed according to the the type specified by the op.

Also this makes the context a part of the theano Type for GpuArray.  This way, most Ops will know what context they are going to work with and it makes it easy for the context to propagate through the graph.

TODO:
- [x] Trivial example with 2 dots on different GPUs.
- [x] Fix crash with tests/optimizations.
- [x] add a way to copy a buffer from one context to another (without passing thought the CPU)
- [x] Fix crash with tests/optimizations and non default context.
- [x] add a way to specify the context of the inputs. (probably a tag with the context name)
- [x] gpu to gpu transfer _as_GpuArrayVariabl
- [ ] replicate Alex models?

I hope by adding the file to the ""tests"" directory the testing framework will pick it up automatically. 

However, we don't have any test to check the formatting of Theano files (like test_format.py in Pylearn2), but maybe we should have it at some point?

This PR should cure the failure of the opencl test script shown on http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html

The code has been before/after tested on my Linux OpenCL system (with an Nvidia graphics card, but no CUDA libraries installed).  For non-OpenCL systems, the gpuarray output should be unchanged.

The PR also solves the central issue behind ""Theano fails when device=opencl #2189"" (where the bug is correctly identified, and a PR is asked for, but the issue was closed because it wasn't clear that libgpuarray hadn't been 'messed with').

Also this should fix:
""stdint.h not found error on MacOS Mavericks when running theano test on OpenCL using libgpuarray"" found at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/theano-users/4HrFKsL5c2w

If this is acceptable, I'd be happy to continue ploughing ahead with OpenCL/gpuarray fixes (since, FWIW, OpenCL is more appealing to this Linux user than CUDA...)

1723,2248,Scan opt to push out Dot products outside of Scan's inner graph,carriepl,"This is still work in progress. Since dealing with Scan is non-trivial, I just want the opportunity to get some feedback to make sure I'm not going in the wrong direction. At the very least, I still have to do the following : 
- Document the code further
- Add tests to validate that the optimization is applied properly

This scan optimization covers the following case : 
- One of the inner graph's output is produced by a Dot operation
- The Dot's inputs are a 2D non-sequence input to scan and a 1D tensor produced by scan's inner function

In the covered case, the optimization adds the 1D intermediate variable as a new scan output and performs the Dot outside of Scan with this new output.

On CPU (i7-950) with input sizes (500,) and (500, 500), the following function
a = T.vector()
b = T.matrix()
c = T.dot(a, b)
f = theano.function([a, b], T.jacobian(c, a))

1725,2255,Slightly clean up registration of GPU convolution optimizers,f0k,"As discussed [on theano-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/theano-dev/QEB-KAaMT-Q), this changes the registration of GPU-based convolution optimizers in the following way:
- The optimizer moving convolutions to GPU is pulled out of the `LocalGroupDB` named `conv_groupopt` in sandbox/cuda/opt.py
- `conv_groupopt` now only includes the optimizers replacing the legacy convolution with alternative implementations; they are registered via a group so they are tried in a specific order and we can control which ones to prefer.
- The tags they are registered with do not include the `local_` prefix any more. They are user-facing, so they should be user-friendly. The two FFT-related optimizers are registered under a common tag `conv_fft` to make it easier to include or exclude them.
- The `local_conv_dnn` optimizer of sandbox/cuda/dnn.py is only registered as part of `conv_groupopt`, not on its own any more. Otherwise we lose control over the order the optimizers are tried in.

If you're fine with the tags, let me know and I'll update the documentation accordingly in a separate commit.

It assumes that cuda.h, cudnn.h and cudnn.so are available in standard system-wide include and library directories, while during the compilation of the cuDNN ops, it is enough if they are available in CUDA's include and library directories.
This PR includes cuda.h before cudnn.h to not give a ""cudnn.h is not found"" error if even cuda.h cannot be found (to avoid pointing the user in the wrong direction on what to fix). In addition, it adds the CUDA include and lib directories to the GCC call via -I and -L, respectively.

Alternatively, the check could just use nvcc instead of gcc, but I don't know if that's easy to accomplish.

1730,2266,conv2d meta-optimizer,f0k,"This is a basic implementation of meta-optimization (#2072) for GPU-based convolutions. The idea of meta-optimization is to automatically choose the best-performing implementation of several alternatives provided by regular graph optimizers.

It introduces a local optimizer base class that for each node it is asked to replace, tries all local optimizers registered with it to determine which is the fastest, then chooses that. To time an implementation, it needs to be compiled into a function and run. This in turn requires non-symbolic inputs for the Apply node to be optimized. Inputs that are shared variables have data associated with them, so they can be used directly. Inputs that have a test value attached are replaced by shared variables of that value. Any other inputs need to be taken care of by subclasses of the base class.
For convolution, I make use of the fact that Apply nodes often know the expected input shape, so we can create random input data of the correct shape to compile the functions (see `ConvMetaOptimizers.provide_inputs()`).

Currently, the meta-optimizer is turned on by setting `THEANO_FLAGS=optimizer_including=conv_meta`. It then tries all convolution optimizers currently available in Theano (cudnn, gemm, and fft) regardless of whether they are active or not. It currently does not include the legacy convolution in the timing, because this usually just slows everything down. Additional optimizers (e.g., for cuda-convnet) can be registered at runtime via its `register` method (e.g., `theano.sandbox.cuda.opt.conv_metaopt.register(my_own_optimizer)`).

This PR can be merged as is. The following should be addressed in future:
- I would prefer to have it try only the optimizers that are active (i.e., cudnn and gemm if they haven't been deactivated, and fft only if it has been activated), is there an easy way to do so?
- For gemm, it should try both `GpuCorrMM` and `GpuCorrMM_gradWeights` if both are applicable, not rely on the heuristic in `local_conv_gemm`.
- Timings should be cached on disk to speed up repeated invocations.
- A second meta-optimizer for pooling could be added, once we have enough competing implementations.

This also chooses between GpuDnnConv and GpuDnnConvGradW depending on what the original purpose of the convolution was in the graph. For me the gradient wrt. weights is faster than before, but still quite a bit slower than manually using GpuDnnConv. I cannot look into this any more today, but if anyone wants to have a try, please go ahead. The goal would be to find out if it's slower because of extra dimshuffles/copies, or because I did something wrong.

1747,2287,Reduce the number of allocation/reuse allocation of ndarray #1943,royxue,"Note about this PR before merging:
- This is the first step of gh-1943. If the Loop or LoopGC VM get used and allow_gc is False and no lazy operation, we will reuse some intermediate memory storage. We do this by making the storage_map of some variable point to the same list. We carefully check which variable can be shared. This make that some thunk will have there output available when they run.
- Currently this is done only for variable where ndim == 0. A follow up ticket will generalize this.

(@maintainers: You might want to merge things on the command line from time to time instead of requiring third-party contributors to rebase their requests again and again. Of course sometimes they're the only ones who know their code well enough to do the rebase, but sometimes it's the other way round and sometimes it's just a trivial conflict that maintainers can solve just as well as part of the merge. This being said, I'm of course grateful you keep Theano that lively and well, and make it possible to contribute in a timely fashion!)

@nouiz: Regarding 07dd0f1, note that we're actually calling the function more than once (currently three times, but that could be configurable) to get a good timing. At least for FFT this is absolutely necessary because the first call takes more time. Should we keep output borrowing then?

1771,2319,[ENH] Matrix exponential op and gradient (round 2!),rmcgibbo,"- Adds a new matrix exponential Op to slinalg.py, implemented with scipy.linalg.expm.
- Adds an op for the gradient of the matrix exponential.

This is a reworking of #2285. I fixed the math. It works for general (non-necessarily hermetian) arguments. [This test](https://github.com/rmcgibbo/Theano/blob/expm/theano/tensor/tests/test_slinalg.py#L273-L280) is with an arbitrary 5x5 matrix, without the restriction to symmetric matricies or anything.

The optimization is, however, correctly applied in the TestPushOutSumOfDot.test_machine_translation() test case which comes from from https://github.com/rizar/scan-grad-speed

1833,2423,Add breakpoint Op to Theano,carriepl,"This is just a small utility class to allow a user to put a conditional breakpoint, with pdb, inside the execution of a Theano function. It is implemented in a similar way to the Print() op in that it's a identity-like op with a side effect. It takes multiple inputs and the first one needs to be a 0d tensor and is interpreted as the condition that will decide the activation of the breakpoint. When, during execution, that condition is evaluated to True, the breakpoint will be activated. The subsequent inputs are interpreted as the variables the user wants to monitor and will be made available to the user when the conditional breakpoint activates.

I am not sure what the best way to test this class would be. It is easy enough to test that the breakpoint doesn't activate in a particular case but testing that it does activate seems a little bit more subtle.

1885,2515,AdvancedSubtensor1 support for local_useless_subtensor optimization,sisp,"I added `AdvancedSubtensor1` support for the `local_useless_subtensor` optimization where the following cases are optimized:
- `x[[0,1,...,#rows(x) - 1]] -> x` with a constant vector
- `x[T.arange(x.shape[0])] -> x`

I'm not sure if there is an `AdvancedSubtensor` case, too. The only one I could imagine would be `x[[0,0,...,1,1,...,#rows(x),#rows(x),...], [0,1,...,#cols(x),0,1,...,#cols(x),...]].reshape((#rows(x), #cols(x))` given `x` is a matrix (could be generalized for all tensors). Is this worth the effort? It seems like a very unlikely case, but I could do it if you feel it should be included. What I'm no clear about, though, is if that's actually a case for this optimization because the `AdvancedSubtensor` op will give a vector in any case. Only combined with `reshape` will this be a equivalent to just using `x` instead of the indexing + reshaping.

In the picture, ""Alloc id=8"" is unnecessary because the broadcastable scalar resulting from the fused elementwise ops is simply repeated, but `IncSubtensor` and `AdvancedIncSubtensor1` can broadcast a scalar increment automatically. I added a new optimization that fixes this case.

1921,2572,[WIP] add equivalent of mgrid/ogrid functionality,eickenberg,"With reference to [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/theano-users/ueOfrjiYvZA/TrqAMQSi8ewJ) here is, albeit a lot later than I would have liked, an implementation of the `numpy.mgrid/ogrid` functionality for `theano.tensor`.

The basic idea is already coded, along with some equivalence tests to the numpy functionality.

However, some questions remain:
- Do we want the ""imaginary step sizes shorthand"", which turns step size into _number of steps, endpoint included_. I find this behavior slightly scary in the theano context, so for now it is not implemented.
- I added a few rudimentary tests, but I am probably missing some standard catches to test for. Please comment if this is the case.
- I added a docstring for the `_ndgrid` class. However, `mgrid` and `ogrid` are instances of these classes and should have different docstrings explaining their functionality. In numpy this is solved by injecting docstrings a posteriori into these instances. Is there a standard for doing this in theano as well?

1922,2574,Flatten C code,sisp,"I added C code to the `Flatten` op. @lamblin mentioned in another PR that it is desirable to avoid multiple C code variants per op. The current implementation is parameterized by `outdim` which will cause a precompiled module per `outdim` value. There are two options: 1) `outdim` remains a constructor argument but is fed to the `Apply` node in `make_node`. Thus, `outdim` would still have to be a constant value and it could be checked in `make_node` as it's done now. 2) `outdim` could become a proper input of the `Flatten` op which means it could change during runtime. It's probably a rare case that someone actually wants to do this. Then, the sanity checks in `make_node` would not be possible anymore in the general case. Which variant do you guys prefer?

I'm not sure about a few things:
1. Does `GpuAllocEmpty` need to implement `__eq__` and `__hash__` or does one of the base classes handle it already? (It seemed to me that the base class implementation only steps in if the class has a `__props__` member.)
2. What should `GpuAllocEmpty.do_constant_folding()` do? For now I always return `False`. I don't know anything about the constant folding machinery, though.
3. What's needed to make it work in DebugMode? The indeterministic output is problematic, I've heard?

Otherwise it seems to work fine (I don't have a free GPU to run all the tests right now).

PS: I intentionally didn't update `GpuAlloc.c_code_cache_version()` because the returned C code is exactly the same.

1984,2680,Added a config variable to disable the GCC-based cuDNN compilation check,Britefury,"Added a config variable to disable the GCC-based cuDNN compilation check as it breaks on Windows with the GTX900 series CUDA 6.5 and CUDA 7.0.

When using the GTX900 series version of CUDA 6.5 from nVidia on the Windows platform, I have found that this breaks on two different machines, one on Win 8, the other on Win 7, while it _seemed to_ work okay on the non 900 series version (e.g. on an older card with a different CUDA 6.5 toolkit this hack was not necessary). Using CUDA toolkit 7.0 does not fix the issue.

The problem occurs at startup when Theano tests cuDNN with a simple GCC-based test. GCC fails to locate cuda.h:

```
AssertionError: cuDNN optimization was enabled, but Theano was not able to use it. We got this error:
Theano can not compile with cuDNN. We got this error:
c:\\users\\geoff\\appdata\\local\\temp\\try_flags_uk5iph.c:4:18: fatal error: cuda.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
```

This simple hack allows you to put a config variable in your `.theanorc` that will skip this test, allowing Theano to proceed.

There is one problem with the implementation at the moment... which I haven't been able to resolve on my own.

Namely, it is that I cannot estimate the shape of outputs.
The input into `compress` is a vector of bools which represents whether an element/slice should be retained in the output, as well as the matrix being operated on.
I cannot retrieve the dimension of the condition vector.

1996,2697,Autopep!,bartvm,"Since it was mentioned the other day that we want to start working towards PEP8 compliance, I figured I'd let `autopep8` loose on some of the easier errors to fix (spaces after/before `#`, `,`, operators, and too many/few blank lines) and see how it does.

This is a PR with the fixes that I think it applied perfectly without any strange artifacts. It leaves all the C code intact as far as I can tell, and reduces the number of PEP8 violations from 17296 to 9236. E501 and E128 are the two remaining major offenders, but although `autopep8` fixes them nicely in 90% of the cases, it sometimes ends up with some very strange line breaks, so I left those out.

It also brings the whitelist back up to date (some files were missing, and after the change some could be removed).

Let me know if you think is a good way to go, or whether you'd rather have CCW tickets for the next decade! :p

The top errors before `autopep8`:

```
318     E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
336     E225 missing whitespace around operator
353     E127 continuation line over-indented for visual indent
383     E261 at least two spaces before inline comment
412     E251 unexpected spaces around keyword / parameter equals
750     E402 module level import not at top of file
1793    E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent

3806    E501 line too long (87 > 79 characters)
4233    E231 missing whitespace after ','

and afterwards

2008,2717,[CRASH] Fix crash in save_mem when directly using outputs of the scan node,carriepl,"This was found by unit tests in the Blocks framework.

The crash was caused by the save_mem optimization relying on the symbolic outputs of the scan() function being used by the user instead of of the outputs of the scan node. In blocks, they violate this assumption by taking the outputs of the scan() function and doing `x = x.owner.inputs[0]` on each of them to directly obtain the outputs of the scan node.

2014,2727,Stop confusing inner and outer outputs in connection_pattern(),carriepl,"Based on the code and comments, the implementation of scan.connection_pattern appears to confuse inner and outer outputs. The method `get_input_pos()`, means to receive the index of an _inner_ output is called with the indices of _outer_ outputs. This means that if the scan has mitmot outputs with many output taps, some of its recurrent outputs might never be processed.

I tried to come up with a test case for this but couldn't find one where there would be a measurable, observable difference between the connection_pattern before this PR and after. I have a test case which I haven't included where the code behavior is different but the final connection_pattern is identical.

2034,2769,Remove dependance on io_toposort in equal_computations(),carriepl,"Usage of toposort is replaced by parallel depth-first exploration of the two computational graphs. For Kratarth's use case (which admittedly uses huge scans) , it made calls to equal_computations roughly 200x faster.

I launched all the tests in scan_module/tests/, comparing the output between the old version of `equal_computations()` and the new. They agreed in all cases except in test case test_grad_multiple_outs_some_uncomputable on the graph : 

`[RandomFunction{uniform}(<RandomStateType>, TensorConstant{[]}, TensorConstant{-1.1}, TensorConstant{1.1}), Elemwise{mul,no_inplace}(TensorConstant{2}, u2[t]), RandomFunction{uniform}(<RandomStateType>, TensorConstant{[]}, TensorConstant{-1.1}, TensorConstant{1.1}), dot(u1[t], win_copy), DimShuffle{x}(RandomFunction{uniform}.1), Elemwise{add,no_inplace}(<TensorType(float64, (True,))>, dot.0), Elemwise{add,no_inplace}(Elemwise{add,no_inplace}.0, x0[t-1]), Elemwise{add,no_inplace}(Elemwise{add,no_inplace}.0, DimShuffle{x}.0)]`
and
`[RandomFunction{uniform}(<RandomStateType>, TensorConstant{[]}, TensorConstant{-1.1}, TensorConstant{1.1}), RandomFunction{uniform}(<RandomStateType>, TensorConstant{[]}, TensorConstant{-1.1}, TensorConstant{1.1}), Elemwise{mul,no_inplace}(TensorConstant{2}, u2[t]), dot(u1[t], win_copy), DimShuffle{x}(RandomFunction{uniform}.1), Elemwise{add,no_inplace}(<TensorType(float64, (True,))>, dot.0), Elemwise{add,no_inplace}(Elemwise{add,no_inplace}.0, x0[t-1]), Elemwise{add,no_inplace}(Elemwise{add,no_inplace}.0, DimShuffle{x}.0)]`

which the old implementation evaluated as non-equal (apparently, because the toposort returns the nodes in a different order) where as the new implementation says they are equal.

2074,2841,[CRASH] Improve shared variable management in Scan,carriepl,"~~Those checks were added for the sake of completeness in a previous PR but they were not required for any use case known at that time.~~

~~This PR deactivates them for the time being because it appears these checks are causing issues with valid graphs (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/theano-users/y7Nb8oYRUa0).~~

~~Since they are not required anywhere, they can be deactivated for the time being but we should go back eventually to figure out why.~~

Updated description:
The PR changes the way Scan handles some shared variables as recurrent outputs to make sure the associated and outputs are on the CPU. 

The current way it's implemented would mistakenly have MRG_RandomStreams with an input state on the CPU and the output state on GPU. This wasn't caught by anything but, eventually, through the optimization process, the graph was modified and made consistent so no one ever had any issue with this. The recently-added checks for the consistency of the inner graph caught the inconsistency and that is what caused the crash.

2084,2855,Scan memory reuse,carriepl,"This PR fixes two bug in the currently deactivated memory pre-allocation feature in Scan and activates it in both the Python and Cython backends. This means that is doesn't fix bugs that are currently occurring but rather it fixes the memory pre-allocation so that we can use it without introducing bugs.

The first bug it fixes comes from an optimization in `GpuDimshuffle` in the cuda gpu backend where, to avoid creating a new array, it can reuse the one it receives as input and alter its attributes, including the `gpudata` attribute. This caused an issue in the old code for the memory pre-allocation because it relied on the assumption that a given CudaNdarray object would always point to the same memory region and that if an Op needed to return a CudaNdarray pointing to a new memory region, it would create a new one and leave the original untouched.

The second bug comes from the SaveMem optimization and the fact that it tries (if it can) to keep a circular buffer only as small as the number of states required at any given iteration to compute the next state. This works without the memory reuse feature because all the outputs of the inner function are computed and then they are put in the buffers. With the memory reuse, since the outputs are stored in the buffers as they are computed by the inner function, the buffers need to be at least 1 element bigger so that the new states can be stored without overwriting the oldest state that is still used in the inner function.

Now, there are added checks to ensure that the pre-allocated array has been reused _and_ that it still points to the same data.

2095,2871,"(#2613, #2747) Add handling of negative axis for Join and GpuJoin",bouthilx,"(#2613, #2747)

Negative axis were automatically handled by numpy implementation inside
Join.{perform,c_code}. However, both Join.grad and
GpuJoin.{perform,c_code,grad} implementations were not thought to take care of
negative axis.

This commit adds convertion of axis when negative such that it is always
positive. Fixing it in Join._make_node_internal also fix GpuJoin at the
same time. Symbolic axis need to be taken care of by adding a
tensor.switch to increment axis when necessary. However, assert_op can
be removed by some optimizer modes and thus exceeding negative axis can
be undetected. Another option is to hardcode asserts in
{Gpu}Join.{perform, c_code} but that means maintaining a similar code
4 times...

This op is useful for calculating various things related to Gaussian distributions, such as truncated moments and expressions involving log(cdf(x)) for large negative values of x. The contributed code very closely follows that of the Erfinv op.

- extend the C implementation of Downsample to support `average_inc_pad` and `average_exc_pad`,
- add a new `sum` mode to the Python and C implementations.

The C implementation for the `average_*` modes reuses most of the code from `max`. The `sum` mode is a relatively straightforward extension.

The classes T_Scan_Cuda and T_Scan_Gpuarray inherit from ScanGpuTests and TestCase and implement these attributes/methods so that the tests will rely on their respective backends.

The method `get_output_pos()` allowed to travel between inner inputs and inner outputs of recurrent states. I removed it because : 
- It only worked for variables representing recurrent states (I added another method which can deal with any inner input)
- The method's documentation implied that it could be used for any inner input even it that wasn't the case. This was confusing and just begged for the function to be misused by an unsuspecting user.
- The method WAS actually misused in ScanOp.grad() where it was, by mistake, called to travel between inner inputs and **outer** outputs. This didn't cause any error when taking the gradient of a user-defined Scan node because, in the absence of mitmots, the number of inner outputs associated with recurrent states is equal to the number of outer outputs associated with recurrent states. When taking the gradient of a grad-scan, this assumption breaks and leads to the crash in some cases.

Maybe we can talk about some of this.

Also, some optimizations, which reprocess outputs don't really need to have their stack traces copied over (I think). For example: 
- local_lift_transpose_through_dot
- local_dimshuffle_no_inplace_at_canonicalize
- local_fill_to_alloc (first two returns at least)

These take the inputs to the node and output another tensor variable. The stacktrace should be constructed appropriately through the rest of the code.

I have done some easy optimizations in the scan_opt.py. Most of the operations that can be done in constant time by using set or dictionary, previously was being done in linear time inside the loop. It was a bit slow because of that. 

There are a few other changes that I want to do as well. 

These changes speedup by more than 100 secs for a computational graph that was taking more than 900 secs to compile.

2224,3089,[WIP] CpuCorrMM closes #3026,JesseLivezey,"CPU implementation of the CorrMM style convolutions for #3026.

To make sure I understand all of the steps and don't do anything unnecessary, here is my current understanding of what I need to do.

General
- [x] Write real tests, current 'tests' are just copied from tensor.nnet, not sure if they make any sense
- [x] Get tests to pass
- [ ] Move code out of sandbox and into final location (tensor.nnet?)

C code
- [x] write im2col and col2im for cpu
- [x] write cormm for cpu
- [x] float 32 and 64 versions

Theano
- [x] write ops
  - [x] BaseCpuCorrMM
  - [x] CpuCorrMM
  - [x] CpuCorrMM_gradWeights
  - [x] CpuCorrMM_gradInputs

Later PRs
- Write optimization to swap conv ops (waiting on #2665)
- Add 'same' mode for cpu and gpu versions

2277,3163,Performance improvement for GpuCrossentropySoftmaxArgmax1HotWithBias,mjwillson,"After a bit of profiling this op turned out to be a massive bottleneck in training a smaller feedforward network with a large-ish (10000 class) softmax output layer, taking 40 to 60% of the total time, much more than any of the dot22 / gemm linear algebra ops which really should be the bottleneck.

On investigation it turned out the GPU kernel for this op was only using a single thread, with a TODO to fix it. This commit implements that TODO. This op now only takes around 6% of the total time for me. It could probably be optimised further (e.g. via hierarchical / multi-stage reductions) but I think this is worth submitting.

Tagging @jaberg as it looks like this was your code originally. It's my first theano contribution and I'm relatively new to CUDA so let me know if you notice anything wrong. The relevant tests still pass at least.

Incidentally the CPU implementation of this op seems suspiciously slow too, although I didn't focus on optimising that because I'm mainly using GPU.

2284,3176,Remove the restriction on zero target dimensions when reshaping a CudaNdarray,mjwillson,"Fixes #3175 for me.

I couldn't see any obvious problems with removing this restriction (which isn't applied by the CPU backend). But perhaps there was some cuda-specific reason for the stricter restriction here?

There was a commit (https://github.com/Theano/Theano/commit/23fa09f02d731ca0a5437772cf6118ca16c542c9) made to permit reshaping of zero-size arrays before, which looks like it fixed this issue but was partially undone again at some point in a merge.

## What you need to do is make an optimization that isn't enabled by default, but if enable by the user, would convert the op GpuCorrMM3d to GpuDnnConv3d, and the same for the 2 grad ops. You need to test that by default, we don't introduce it and that if we include the opt mode.including('opt_name'), we do it. Also, double check the timming, currently, previous pre-release version had the cudnn version slower then the cormm version. That is why we don't want to enable it by default. But it use less memory, so we want to allow this option.

So far I've done the part of replacing GpuCorr3dMM with GpuDnnConv3d, not with the grads yet. I need to lean more about the difference between those grad ops in order to transform one to the other.

That's because it collects required inputs from the original GpuConv Op prior to applying any optimizers, and it may happen that the optimizers render one of the inputs unneeded (I haven't looked into this, but I assume it could be due to the output shape computation or something).
This PR fixes this by allowing the function compiled for timing the replaced Op to accept inputs it doesn't actually need (`on_unused_input='ignore'`).

2332,3258,Early detection of device capability for proper cuda_ndarray compilation,ivannz,"Dear developers,

upon a fresh installation of **theano** I ran into the problem where there was a mismatch between the architecture on which **cuda_ndarray** library was compiled and the architecture setting of compiled apply nodes. Basically calling some kernel functions from **cuda_ndarray.cu** (specifically **k_elemwise_unary_rowmajor_copy**) resulted in ""invalid device function"" error. Due to hardware reasons I have to use CUDA driver 6.5, which still supports old devices like the one I have: GeForce 320M (SM version 1.2).

The problem hid in the fact that the code for device capability detection resides in **cuda_ndarray** module, which had to be compiled upon the very first import of theano. The compilation in **__ init __.py** of **theano/sandbox/cuda** invokes **nvcc_compiler.compile_str()**, which in turn tries to detect device capabilities using the yet nonexistent **cuda_ndarray** module, and obviously fails. Thus the compilation of **cuda_ndarray** defaulted to some architecture of nvcc compiler, which turned out to be backwards incompatible with sm12.

That is why is patched the **__ init __.py** code so that it first tries to compile a lightweight module for early device capability detection (**cuda_devquery.cu**), and then, upon success, uses the correct device dependent flags for **cuda_ndarray** compilation.

I had to modify some extra code in **__ init __.py**, specifically the parts where CUDA availability is detected and where the compiled module is checked for being correct and up-to-date (former **try_import()**).

Please consider this patch request and send your remarks and suggestions.

Ivan

The alternative was making Scan support having 0 steps at execution time but that would still involve running the Scan for at least one iteration so that the output shapes would be known : even if the scan is supposed to run 0 steps and return empty outputs, these outputs still need to have the right shape.

Now the replacement descends into scan nodes. For some reason that I don't understand, I need to keep track of those scan nodes that I have already replaced. Otherwise the local optimizer will be called again and again on the replaced node. Changing the order from out_to_in to in_to_out doesn't change that.

I'll sort out the mess of imports later.

2371,3322,d3viz: Interactive visualization of Theano compute graphs,cangermueller,"`d3viz` extends Theano’s printing module
to interactively visualize compute graphs. Instead of creating a static
picture, it creates an HTML file, which can be opened with any
web-browser. `d3viz` allows
-  to zoom to different regions and to move graphs via drag and drop,
-  to position nodes both manually and automatically,
-  to retrieve additional information about nodes and edges such as
  their data type or definition in the source code,
-  to edit node labels,
-  to visualizing profiling information, and

2388,3364,"Use the libgpuarray APIs to manage GPU code compilation, execution, etc.",seanprime7,"Currently, the gpuarray back end of Theano uses a mixture of libgpuarray and nvcc, which is slow for online compilation.  We can speed up the GPU code compilation using libgpuarray API alone without nvcc, especially when libgpuarray is built with the nvrtc support (see https://github.com/Theano/libgpuarray/pull/72).

This hopefully helps managing GPU related code in Theano and libgpuarray by having vendor specific implementation only in libgpuarray.

-Adding new tests
-Make the NoOutputFromInplace feature and optimization parameterizable
-Add a register() method to class Mode to allow including optimization instances (not only tags) to compilation modes.
-Allow usage of In() input wrappers without forcing the usage of old Theano functions

- this fix is inspired by Dan Povey's fix for Kaldi:
  kaldi-asr/kaldi@6548565
- it does a loop over gpus until a free gpu is taken.
- pycuda initialization was also affected by the bug from CUDA 7.0, so it is better to disable it.

Imported what seemed relevant from pascanur:downsampling_rop branch (PR #622).
When comparing the two code bases, the pascanur branch seems quite archaic.

I am not familiar with the Theano code base, so I did my best pythonic guesses. I most certainly introduced bugs. This code will need heavy testing and/or upgrades.

`test_rop.py` includes a test for the new feature, and it currently fails.

2421,3435,Scan grad speedup,carriepl,"NOTE : I'm still in the process of testing this change but it might still be good to start getting feedback. Since this changes the graphs that result from taking gradients of Scan nodes, it may mean that new optimizations that were previously not needed would now be more useful/important.

This PR modifies the way Scan takes the gradient of it's inner function. Instead of doing nb_inputs \\* nb_outputs calls to grad to get the gradient of its inner function, it now does only one such call. This makes grad() generally faster but even more so in the case of taking the gradient of nested scans in which the number of calls to grad() would increase exponentially with the number of levels of nested scans. Because of the reduced number of calls to grad() the resulting scan grads have simple graphs and less duplicate nodes so optimization is faster and (because we don't have optimizations for every single case) execution is sometimes faster. Also, execution with no/few optimizations (i.e. FAST_COMPILE), execution is much much faster.

On the LSTM tutorial, on my machine, the time to take the gradients goes from 0.30 to 0.15 seconds, the compilation time goes from 16s to 13s and the time to run the scan_grad drops by ~40% resulting in a global ~20% drop in execution time.

On the following (not-rigorous) graph using nested scans, the time to take the gradients goes from 6.9s to 0.7s seconds, the compilation time goes from 18s to 7s but the execution time stayed the same because the resulting Theano function was the same as without this change.

2465,3519,Add imports to keep old sandbox interface,bouthilx,"According to [lucasb-eyer](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/3311#issuecomment-148326471), the PR #3311 broke the interface of `sandbox` by adding `__init__.py` which turned it into a python module. 

> I believe adding the `__init__.py` file in the sandbox folder as part of 5b604a4 has the side-effect of breaking existing code that directly used anything other than sandbox.opt, such as writing `theano.sandbox.rng_mrg.MRG_RandomStreams()` . I don't think it's too bad, just putting the information out there.

I added imports as in `theano/tensor/__init__.py` but I'm worried some of `sandbox`'s modules were not built to be imported automatically. Would it introduce some bugs or a useless and significant import overhead?

So far I only tested with `device=cpu` and only problem I see is this deprecation warning

``` python
DEPRECATION: theano.sandbox.conv no longer provides conv.  They have been moved to theano.tensor.nnet.conv
```

Because `theano.tensor.nnet.conv` was not automatically imported previously. We would soon have the same problem with `blocksparse` once #3361 is merged.

If we split the 2 gemm each in a function, we kepp the 1.95x speed up.

If we add one gpu to cpu transfer after the gemm and keep 2 function each with 1 gemm and 1 transer, we loose the speed up. We get a speed up (slowdown) of 0.92x again the version without tranfers and ONE GPU.

If we use 2 threads, each with its function without transfer, go drop to 1.93x speed up.
But if we do the same with the gemm + transfer, we go from a slowdown of 0.92x to a speed up of 1.61x.

Probably many of them are not practically relevant, but do you see any potential performance problems from implementing it this way? I.e., should we reduce this to a few relevant Ops, or implement it such that it looks for a `T.switch` first?

2610,3845,"Add border_mode=""half"" to cuDNN convolutions",f0k,"The new `conv2d()` interface supports `border_mode=""half""` for same convolutions. However, the cudnn convolution interface in Theano does not support it. `local_abstractconv_cudnn()` does not take care of this. Thus, the following fails when cuDNN is available:

``` python
In [1]: import theano
Using gpu device 0: Tesla K40c (CNMeM is enabled)

In [2]: x, w = theano.tensor.tensor4s('xw')

In [3]: c = theano.tensor.nnet.conv2d(x, w, border_mode='half')

In [4]: f = theano.function([x, w], c)

ERROR (theano.gof.opt): Optimization failure due to: LocalOptGroup(local_abstractconv_cudnn,local_conv_dnn,local_abstractconv_gemm,local_abstractconv_gradinputs_gemm,local_abstractconv_gradweight_gemm,local_conv_gemm)

ERROR (theano.gof.opt): Traceback (most recent call last):
  [...]
ValueError: invalid border_mode half, which must be either ""valid"", ""full"", an integer or a pair of integers
```

An easy fix would be modifying `local_abstractconv_cudnn()` to catch `border_mode=""half""` and replace it with a suitable tuple of integers. It's difficult to adapt `test_abstractconv.py` accordingly, though, because it uses the cuDNN convolution as a reference. Plus it would only work for convolutions that have a filter size specified at compile time.

So I opted for changing `theano.sandbox.cuda.dnn` to include support for the ""half"" border mode, which wasn't very difficult either. `test_abstractconv.py` fails for me, but it also fails for the latest master.
`test_dnn.py` still needs updates for the shape inference tests (to not give repeated values).

It turns out TensorConstant constructor tries to find if all items in tensor are the same using inefficient algorithm - it calls np.unique several times which does unneeded work, including sorting of all unique values. The delay is visible on constants of moderate size:

``` python
a = np.random.random((2000, 2000))

%timeit len(np.unique(a)) == 1
1 loops, best of 3: 342 ms per loop

%timeit (a == a.ravel()[0]).all()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.13 ms per loop
```

After the fix (removing np.unique overhead) Theano becomes more responsive in the original example:

2624,3869,scan: remove unconditional warning when strict=True is used,kmike,"A PR for #3333. Just faced this issue today and spent some time debugging, thinking something is wrong with my code.

An objection was that error message is not clear enough without this warning. This is the error message:

```
MissingInputError: A variable that is an input to the graph was 
neither provided as an input to the function nor given a value. 
A chain of variables leading from this input to an output is 
[b_output, HostFromGpu.0, Elemwise{add,no_inplace}.0, DimShuffle{x,0}.0, Softmax.0]. 
This chain may not be unique

```

for me (a Theano novice) it looks clear enough - strict=True must be set explicitly, so I've read Theano docs about this argument before setting it, and was expecting this kind of errors; error message even pointed to the offending variable.

2630,3883,[ENH] add bessel0,skaae,"Adding Scipy Bessel function. 

I have a few questions:

1) The PR adds both bessel0 and bessel1. Bessel1 is only added because I don't know how to call 
scipy.special.j1 when calculating the gradietn of bessel0?

2) Is `bessel0` ok for name? Alternatively i can call it `j0` to match scipy?

3) Not sure how tests work. I think i should follow https://github.com/jsalvatier/Theano-1/commit/b18e04323d91c29918341ffdb14501399a6f2acf and add them to `theano/tensor/tests/test_basic.py

2651,3916,Option for passing additional libraries for the GCC.,machpavel,"When using Theano on windows, I ran into a problem with linking - I needed to link package libpython.
So in .theanorc, I added

> [gcc]
> cxxflags = -Lc:\\Anaconda3\\libs -llibpython34

but that did not solve the issue.
Finally, I find out that it is because cxxflags are passed as the first arguments for the GCC - but GCC only accepts -l switch when it is passed AFTER source files.
Therefore, I modified python code that generates the GCC command, so it can accept additional libraries from the configuration. Now, my GCC section of .theanorc looks like this and the problem is solved:

> [gcc]
> cxxflags = -shared -Ic:\\mingw\\mingw32\\include -Lc:\\Anaconda3\\libs -DMS_WIN64

2697,4007,GPU triangular solve op,matt-graham,"## Reason for PR

This in some way extends on from #3994 which makes some proposed changes to the general CULA based `GpuSolve` op with the aim of making it more compatible with the `slinalg.Solve` op. 

The current `slinalg.Solve` op has an `A_structure` property which can be used to provide information about special structure in the matrix system being solved. Currently as well as the normal general dense solver the `slinalg.Solve` op also uses a specific solver for triangular systems if `A_structure` is one of `lower_triangular` or `upper_triangular`. Having a GPU triangular solve op would make the GPU based functionality equivalent and potentially give significant performance gains over using a general solver when the system is known to be triangular given the O(D<sup>2</sup>) cost compared to O(D<sup>3</sup>) cost for a general solver (this is ignoring however possible differences in degree of parallelism and so GPU speed up).

Combined with #4006 this PR would also allow efficient and numerically stable GPU-based solving of positive definite linear systems via the Cholesky decomposition of the matrix.
## Description of proposed changes

A new CUBLAS based `GpuTriangularSolve` op is defined in a new module `cublas.py`, this mainly just a wrapper around the `skcuda.cublas.cublasStrsm` single-precision triangular linear system solver function and very closely following the structure of the existing CULA based `GpuSolve` op.

The `local_gpu_solve` optimization is also updated to replace `slinalg.Solve` ops in which the `A_structure` property is set to one of `lower_triangular` or `upper_triangular` with instances of the new `GpuTriangularSolve` op, with the current `GpuSolve` op used as the fallback for other `A_structure` values.

Tests for the new op and edited optimization are also defined.
## Questions
- Is there a more logical existing module for the `GpuTriangularSolve` op to exist in rather than creating a new `cublas.py` module? One possibility seems to be the existing [sandbox/cuda/blas.py](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/sandbox/cuda/blas.py) however this currently only contains ops directly implemented with CUDA / CUBLAS C-code as opposed to this op which just wraps a `skcuda.cublas` function. Another option would be to combine with the op(s) in [sandbox/cuda/cula.py](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/sandbox/cuda/cula.py) to group all the `skcuda` based ops together.
- I am not sure if the `atexit` based method of making sure the `cublas.cublasDestroy` function is called on any initialized CUBLAS handle before exiting is the best approach?

2730,4084,cuDNN header / library paths fix,matt-graham,"## Reason for PR

This is a proposed fix #4082.
## Description of proposed changes

The PR causes  `config.dnn.include_path` and `config.dnn.library_path` to be included in the compile commands for CUDA backend cuDNN ops by adding them to the lists returned by the `c_header_dirs` and `c_lib_dirs` methods of the cuDNN related ops in `sandbox/cuda/__init__.py` and `sandbox/cuda/dnn.py`.

To make sure the user specified library paths are given greater precedence by the compiler it also switches the order in which the `lib_dirs` list is constructed in `NVCC_compiler.compile_str` in `sandbox/cuda/nvcc_compiler`, with the user specified library paths put at the start of the list (rather than being added after the standard libraries returned by `std_lib_dirs()` as currently). This is already the behaviour for the `include_dirs`. For consistency I also switched the order for `libs` analagously as well though this isn't actually needed to fix #4082.

2758,4145,Improve code misleading tiny issues for Loop of Tutorial.,myme5261314,"The Loop(scan) chapter is a little misleading for reader (at least for me). The `outputs=[results]`, `outputs=results`, `print xxx_fun(...)[0]` and `print xxx_fun(...)` should be in one style to avoid missing reader guess if it's the special situation of the special difficult content `scan` that result in the with/without `[0]`.

Just for curiosity, is the `scan` function which justify **list of rows** into numpy ndarray? Here's the example in the tutorial.

``` python
# define tensor variables
X = T.matrix(""X"")
W = T.matrix(""W"")
b_sym = T.vector(""b_sym"")

# define shared random stream
trng = T.shared_randomstreams.RandomStreams(1234)
d=trng.binomial(size=W[1].shape)

results, updates = theano.scan(lambda v: T.tanh(T.dot(v, W) + b_sym) * d, sequences=X)
compute_with_bnoise = theano.function(inputs=[X, W, b_sym], outputs=[results],
                          updates=updates, allow_input_downcast=True)
x = np.eye(10, 2, dtype=theano.config.floatX)
w = np.ones((2, 2), dtype=theano.config.floatX)
b = np.ones((2), dtype=theano.config.floatX)

print(compute_with_bnoise(x, w, b))
```

The result is 

``` python
[array([[ 0.96402758,  0.        ],
       [ 0.        ,  0.96402758],

       [ 0.76159416,  0.76159416]])]
```

I mean each iter of `X` is a row vector of `X`, right? if the `results` is actually only the list of the outputs, the above result should be a list of **row vector** right? but it seems to be a numpy ndarray. I want to know if this is caused by `scan` function internally.

2759,4148,Symbolic Cholesky gradient implementation,matt-graham,"## Reason for PR

The existing `CholeskyGrad` implementation is implemented with triply nested Python loops which is very slow as noted in #2058, #207 and #208. It also does not have a `grad` method specified meaning it is not possible to differentiate through a `Cholesky` op multiple times. Given it is an atomic op defined directly in python it will also not be optimised to run on the GPU.

There has recently been a [note put on arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07527) giving a simple symbolic expression for the reverse-mode gradient updates for the Cholesky decomposition, which has been used to update the Cholesky gradient implementations in [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/commit/024909c58f53b84f5a1c1ab60488c4668284898c#diff-580a144ef545fa15f38dd963feb9aa80) (just for full disclosure, the author of the note, Iain Murray @imurray, is an academic in the department I am PhD student in and this PR in partially in response to discussions with him).

This symbolic definition of the Cholesky gradient can be implemented entirely using existing Theano atomic ops with this PR implementing a first attempt at this. This version already gives a significant speed up on the CPU over the existing implementation for larger matrices (mean of >250× speedup for 200×200 inputs) and no obvious penalty even for small inputs:

![profiling_results](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6746980/13436129/ab638b5a-dfd5-11e5-99eb-4f149fb0ddae.png)

It's probable that further performance gains could be achieved some adding some graph optimisations, adding an in-place mode to the `slinalg.Cholesky` op and/or defining a new atomic `CholeskyGrad` op which uses the blocked algorithms also discussed in the arXiv note for larger inputs (there are existing reference python implementations for these by @imurray [here](https://github.com/imurray/chol-rev/blob/master/python/chol_diff.py).

Currently with this alternative `grad` implementation the `Cholesky` op still cannot be differentiated through multiple times as the current `Solve` op does not have a `grad` method implemented. This should be easy to address however (I will add a separate PR for this).

To enable evaluation of gradients of functions involving the Cholesky Op on the GPU should also be much easier with this implementation - most of the atomic ops used in the symbolic expression should already optimise to GPU equivalents, with the major exception being the Cholesky decomposition itself though there has been some work done implementing this in #4006. Currently there is also only a general dense GPU solve op with information about triangular structure ignored however there is a start at attempting to deal with this in #4007 and #3994.
## Description of changes

Rather than creating a `CholeskyGrad` op instance in the `Cholesky.grad` method, here this is replaced instead with a direct symbolic implementation of the gradient updates following the method described in the arXiv note.

Additionally `solve_lower_triangular` and `solve_upper_triangular` op instances are defined to make the calls to the `slinalg.Solve` op more legible.
## Questions
- I've currently left the existing `CholeskyGrad` implementation in place and just defined the symbolic reverse-mode gradient updates directly in the `Cholesky.grad` method. Is there any way to wrap a symbolic expression as an op so that a new `CholeskyGrad` op could be defined from this (assuming some separate `CholeskyGrad` op should be provided for backwards compatibility)? 
- Rather than defining the `solve_lower_triangular` and `solve_upper_triangular`  instances globally I could just define them locally inside the method if preferred?
- I'm not sure if I am using the most efficient method for halving the diagonal of a matrix - I couldn't see any obvious better solution though as `fill_diagonal` can only be used with a scalar and it doesn't seem to be feasible to use `inc_subtensor`. Possibly an optimisation could be added for patterns like `mtx_1 + scalar * tensor.diag(tensor.diagonal(mtx_2))` to make this an in place update to the diagonal were possible? Or would this already be dealt with?

2763,4153,Gradient implementation for Solve op,matt-graham,"## Reason for PR

Current `tensor.slinalg.Solve` has no `grad` method implemented as noted in #1567 and #4148. This in particular in response to #4148 as implementing the reverse-mode gradient updates for `Solve` is needed to allow arbitrary order differentiation through the `Cholesky` op as noted there.
## Description of proposed changes

This implements the reverse-mode gradient updates for the `Solve` op using the symbolic expressions given in [Giles (2008)](http://eprints.maths.ox.ac.uk/1079/). It exploits triangular structure in the input matrix (first input) if specified by the `A_structure` argument, or defaults to a general dense implementation for other `A_structure` values.

A unit test performing a series of `verify_grad` checks for different input dimensions and matrix structures is also defined.

2764,4154,Fix blocksparse,abergeron,"I couldn't fix the direct problem with #3978, but I noticed that there was no infer_shape or proper equality functions.

In addition I changed the subtensors in h_softmax to dimshuffles since they are lighter to perform.

I also fixed the broadcastable handling in CPU ops since that was needed for the dimshuffle change.

With all these changes the problem goes away and the graph looks leaner, so I would say that it's a fix.

2798,4235,Decoding nvcc outputs in correct encoding.,cai-lw,"`nvcc` calls `cl` (Visula Studio C/C++ compiler), and `cl` outputs are in ""current ANSI console codepage"" (see [Visual Studio Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xwy0e8f2%28v=vs.120%29.aspx)). If the encoding is not UTF8 and the output contains non-ASCII characters (very likely to happen if the VS installation is in Asian languages), the default `decode()` will result in an exception.
There had been an issue #3551 that reported the problem, but remained untreated for long.
This pull request fixed the problem by adding a function that can decode in specified encoding and compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and detecting encodings of stdout and stderr.

GpuDnnBatchNormInference and GpuDnnBatchNormGrad are compiled and work, but I stuck with GpuDnnBatchNorm because in this function two variables are input and output variables at the same time. I tried to use view_map or destroy_map attributes but couldn’t make it works. Now GpuDnnBatchNorm is compiled, but when I attempted to execute it, I see Segmentation Fault.

2820,4271,[WIP] Scan with checkpoint,carriepl,"This is work in progress. It will probably need more documentation, more (and more rigorous, the current ones only print stuff) tests, more features, better default value for the new function argument, etc. I'm only making a PR so that there is a trace of this work.

This adds a new function `theano.scan_with_checkpoints` with an interface similar to scan but it is designed to reduce memory usage as much as possible compared to the original, at the cost of additional computation. The general idea is, during the fprop, only save the states every `n` timesteps instead of every timestep. This means that, during the bprop, a partial recomputation of the fprop will be required but much less data will ever need to be in memory at the same time. 

Currently, the code has several assumptions :
    - Every sequence has the same length
    - If n_steps is specified, it has the same value as the length of any sequence
    - The value of ""save_every_N"" divides the number of steps the Scan will
      run without remainder
    - Only singly-recurrent and non-recurrent outputs are used.
      No multiple recurrences.
    - Only the last timestep of any output will ever be used.

Took the patch by @lachlants (https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/4237#issuecomment-223466380) and cleaned up / rewrote most of the code so I could understand what it was doing. I guess it was originally derived from the softmax Ops, using `if`s in the base class were inheritance would have made it much easier (so I changed it accordingly).

As per @lachlants idea, this does not cope with updating the running average statistics in the training forward pass, but just hands out the current mini-batch statistics so the user can do whatever she or he pleases. This makes it much easier for the initial version.

Still misses tests, but I've written a small test script to verify that it does the correct thing for all three Ops (will still add tests, of course). Also misses a convenience function. I'd prefer to leave inplace optimizations for future PRs, as well as extending it to support 5d tensors.

- [x] add tests
- [x] add convenience function for inference and training (support 1d to 3d tensors as well)
- [x] add grad() method to inference Op

2955,4587,Implementation of 2D dilated convolution/correlation.,niasla,"Comments:
- For some reason when tensor.nnet.conv2d is called then convop is implemented with the debug slow version in abstract_conv.py. Modified already opt.py (both cpu and gpu versions) and dnn.py (both gpuarray and cuda). The idea is that whenever tensor.nnet.conv2d is called we need to check wether there is dilation and if there is the call conv_gemm implementation. 
- Following the previous point, the TestDnnConv2d in test_sandbox/cuda/tests/abstractconv.py fails. The reason is the use of cuDNN implementation of dilated architectures in tests (should we skip them or adapt with the abstract iface?)

This PR is to optimize current corr_gemm Ops (including corrMM, corrMM_gradWeights and corrMM_gradInputs), which uses openmp to unroll the first loop (batch size level), and it turns out 5.2x (count all these three Ops in) speedup compared than original version.

This optimization collapse the top 2 loops (batch and kernel) to 1 by hand (which can not  be

done by omp collapse since it needs perfect nesting) to achieve a better acceleration ratio on multi-

core systems since only batch level parallelization seems less likely to feeds up the CPUs.

2983,4637,WIP: Theano variable arguments for pooling,Thrandis,"Fixes  #3349

**TODO**:
- [x] Change the interface of the op and the grads.
- [x] Adapt the ""checking"" of the arguments (assert that they are integers, ...).
- [x] Add the `prepare_node` for backward compatibility.
- [x] Write the tests when passing shared variables.
- [x] Write the test for the old interface.
- [x] Update the docstrings.
- [x] Change the c code.
- [x] Make all tests pass.
- [x] Delete `downsample.py`
- [ ] Adapt Theano to the new `Pool` interface
- [x] Merge the code.

**Questions**:
1. @nouiz @mgermain I have 3 errors left in the original tests, all caused by `DownsampleFactorMaxGrad` (from [downsample.py](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/tensor/signal/downsample.py)) Shall I also change its interface?
2. Now that we can pass the window size, padding size, etc. as tensor variable, what kind of checking shall we do on them (like are they of the integer type?)?

2984,4638,Reduce C code generated when using GpuDnnConvDesc,gokul-uf,"Modified GpuDnnConvDesc so that multiple versions of the C code are not created. It now creates just one piece of code which takes the subsample as a parameter instead of hard coding.

Quick testing shows this to be the expected exception when calling split() on a bytes object. Calling decode() on the bytes object fixes this for Python 3, and seems to still work fine in my Python 2.7.11 install.

3026,4737,OpenCL support for Image2Neibs kernels,huanzhang12,"This commit adds OpenCL support for Images2Neibs class. The original Images2Neibs 
kernel was CUDA only, and this patch modifies the kernel so that it is 
compatible with both OpenCL and CUDA with the help of libgpuarray backend.
Also the originally hard-code max threads per block (512) was replaced by
reading the actual max threads per block from the device. On modern Nvidia cards
this number is 1024, so performance should actually improve a little bit.
All modifications shouldn't adversely affect the performance of the original kernel in any ways.

During the development of this OpenCL kernel, a bug of libgpuarray was found and 
was fixed in commit f8b8e156c. So you will need the latest libgpuarray to test the code.

I have tested my code on a AMD R9 280X and a Nvidia Tesla K40c. On the Nvidia GPU
I tested both OpenCL and CUDA backends and all tests pass.

It seems in function InferShapeTester._compile_and_check(), it is checking if the operator class is derived from CumsumOp. Currently the GpuCumsum class is derived from class Op, not CumsumOp, so it fails. I am not sure if it is intentional. To make InferShapeTester happy, I changed the base class of GpuCumsum from Op to CumsumOp, and we can pass all the tests now.

If this is not the right approach, maybe we need to fix InferShapeTester._compile_and_check()? Or maybe it is a known issue?

I also noticed that in earlier versions of extra_ops.py, GpuCumsum was inherited from CumsumOp. But it is removed by [commit d87cf8b4](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/commit/d87cf8b458b626da14e548443424c722f0e89c61). @kelvinxu I am not sure why.

3071,4824,Full 3D convolution for conv3d2d,gvtulder,"This patch adds support for `border_mode='full'` to the 3D convolution in `tensor.nnet.conv3d2d`.

`tensor.nnet.conv2d` already provides full convolution for the H and W dimensions, so the code only has to be changed to support full convolution in the time dimension. I've implemented this by padding the stacked 2D output with zeros using `set_subtensor`. Summing over the output of `DiagonalSubtensor` then provides the result of a full convolution. This approach, unfortunately, requires an additional, temporary array for `set_subtensor`.

3078,4841,"Linting: Pep8 indentation, consistent quotes",Erotemic,"There are no functional changes. I simply fixed a few linting errors.

Several lines in this file were over or under indented. I fixed these 
without moving lines over the 80 character limit. 

There was trailing whitespace. I simply removed it.

I fixed quote consistency. There seems to be a convention that message strings use double quotes and key/flag strings use single quotes. I changed a logging message that used single quotes to use double quotes. 

The biggest change is that there were a few multiline strings of C code defined within functions. 
The multiline strings were indented all the way to the left, which breaks visual nesting of 
 python indentations. I used the builtin textwrap.dedent function to indent these 
lines of code while still preserving the original string representation. 

So, ultimately nothing has changed, the source code just looks nicer.
I'm submitting these changes as a PR before I work on code that will change behavior in this file.

3101,4874,Fix abstractconv_grad dilation and enable border_mode tests,gvtulder,"I think there are a few bugs in commit bbc749ab516 (e.g., lines [1116-L1119 of abstract_conv.py](https://github.com/ballasn/Theano/blob/bbc749ab516a1242d5eb359d1d34cf5fbd031167/theano/tensor/nnet/abstract_conv.py#L1116-L1119), see also #4846), which would give problems with non-symmetric filter dilations for border_modes full or half and with custom padding (which should not be multiplied with the dilation factor).

These errors would have been visible only in the debug mode, if the test had worked. It seems that the test only used the default `border_mode = 'valid'`, but the errors occur with `full` and `half`. This commit should fix that.

Finally, this commit adds `border_mode = ""half""` to the tests.

- [ ]  Make sure all tests pass when the flag is False
- [ ] Make sure most tests pass when the flag is True. For failing test, investigate it this is a normal failure with the new algo. Is so, change the test to expect the failure when using the new algo and expect the old behaviour when using the old algo.
- [ ] Make an even faster version that only check the changed part of the graph by optimization, not the full graph.

3180,5015,Fix random segfault on exit when the new backend is in use.,abergeron,"I had this happen one too many times to me (not counting that even when it doesn't segfault it pollutes the output of cuda-memcheck with a bunch of fake errors.  Anyway here is a long explanation of why it happened from the commit:

The problem is that the old backend assumes it is alone in the
universe and even when not in use will interact with the gpu.  Most
notably in this case it will forcibly destroy any primary context on
exit.  The only problem is that we are also using the primary context
and our cleanup handlers run after those of the old backend.

This is a major problem because cublas uses the runtime api which will
create a context whenever it thinks it needs one (like for cudaFree).
However all the allocations are from the old context that the old
backend destroyed.  So when it tries to clean up its resources the
low-level handlers get confused and we end up in a segmentation fault.

As to why it doesn't always happen, I figure it's because sometimes we
get lucky and addresses line up or something.

Anyway, if we stop the old backend from calling cudaThreadExit() the
segfaults go away.  This may cause a very small leakage of resources
for the few seconds we are running until we exit, but I don't think
this will be a problem.

While trying to build that, I discovered (what I suspect is) a bug in the existing 2D code. It assumes that there is only one maximum per region (unlike the cpu version, which correctly sums all maxima in the region).

Miraculously, the random test samples do not contain multiple maxima, so the 2D test runs correctly. If you give an input of all ones the tests will fail.

The 3D function in this patch is a straightforward copy of the 2D function, so it has the same problem. I 'fixed' this by using unique values in the tests.

Cudnn ignores border and when user sets ignore border to `False` in new backend cpu pooling operations are used which results in significant slowdown. Many people encountered this problem before and quite many theano libraries now issue warning to the user when ignore border is set to false.

3283,5223,DestroyHandler should not overwrite existing rval[app] values,gvtulder,"In PR #5190 I have been having problems with the order in which multiple optimizations run. In some cases, this might incorrectly optimize an Op into an inplace version, even if that that shouldn't be allowed because it destroys variables that are still needed.

I must admit that I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct solution, but this patch seemed to fix my problem. The DestroyHandler is looping through the destroyers and destroyed input to create a dictionary `rval`. It seems to assume that `rval[app]` will always be empty, so it just sets the value. This usually works fine, except in a few rare cases where `rval[app]` already contains a list of nodes. Because the code overwrites `rval[app]`, it will forget about the nodes that were already there. In just the right circumstances, this might cause the optimizer to add in-place Ops that shouldn't be run in-place.

Keeping any existing values in `rval[app]`, as this patch does,  fixes the problem in my case.

It seems quite difficult to trigger this issue. The simplest example I could make can be found [in this example script](https://gist.github.com/gvtulder/e78b4e71e58826350e7afa19845db935). This example has a DummyOp that can work in-place on both of the inputs. The first input is important and should not be modified in-place, because it is reused by the gradient Op, but the second input is not reused and can be changed. There are two separate optimizations that enable the in-place option for each of the two inputs separately. The script runs the computations twice: without the optimizations, which produce the correct answer 114, and with the optimizations, which gives the incorrect answer 123 (caused by the in-place modification of x).

A few notes:
1. I ran this on the gpu because the GpuFromHost makes a copy of the original inputs. This is necessary to get variables that can be modified.
2. I could only get this to work if I also call `gpu_contiguous` on all inputs. This seems to break some dependency chain somewhere. Without `gpu_contiguous` or with only cpu the optimizations would not be accepted.
3. This problem depends on the order of the two optimizations. The inplace_harmless must be enabled before inplace_harmful. If you rename the two optimizations to change the order (opt. 2 to 1 and 1 to 2) the problem doesn't appear.",,nouiz,,2016-11-14 00:06:11,2016-11-29 13:57:31,theano/gof/tests/test_destroyhandler.py theano/gof/destroyhandler.py,bd79d3c85383280974c9ee5df826e650b6e2977e,"nouiz mentioned 2016-11-18 10:08:05,nouiz subscribed 2016-11-18 10:08:05,lamblin mentioned 2016-11-18 10:08:05,lamblin subscribed 2016-11-18 10:08:05,abergeron mentioned 2016-11-18 10:08:05,abergeron subscribed 2016-11-18 10:08:05,gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-11-18 14:24:05,notoraptor mentioned 2016-11-18 16:13:24,notoraptor subscribed 2016-11-18 16:13:24,notoraptor mentioned 2016-11-21 11:34:00,notoraptor subscribed 2016-11-21 11:34:00,lamblin mentioned 2016-11-28 20:07:30,lamblin subscribed 2016-11-28 20:07:30,gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-11-28 20:32:37,nouiz mentioned 2016-11-28 20:33:49,nouiz subscribed 2016-11-28 20:33:49,nouiz referenced 2016-11-29 13:57:31,nouiz merged 2016-11-29 13:57:31,nouiz closed 2016-11-29 13:57:31,gvtulder head_ref_deleted 2016-11-29 15:20:31",gvtulder lamblin abergeron notoraptor nouiz f0k,11,True

3302,5255,Upgraded OpFromGraph with inline support and gradient override,khaotik,"For #5225. Allowing inlined `OpFromGraph` at compile time and overriding gradient.

### Changes:
- ~~Refactored `OpFromGraph` into `OpFromGraphBase` (abstract) and subclass `OpFromGraphPrecompiled`,  `OpFromGraphInline`~~
- ~~`OpFromGraph = OpFromGraphPrecompiled` for compatibility~~
- OpFromGraph `__init__` method now have `inline` argument
- Can now override gradient/Rop for `OpFromGraph*` by supplying `grad_overrides` or `rop_overrides`  parameters respectively.
- Added an graph optimizer to expand inlined `OpFromGraph` at compile time.
- ~~new convenient function `op_from_graph(inputs, outputs, inline=False, grad_overrides=None, rop_overrides=None, **kwargs)`~~
- new tests for `compile/tests/test_builders.py`: `nested`, `grad_override` and `rop_override`
- tests in `compile/tests/test_builders.py` now test against both inline/precompiled mode.
- `name` and `__str__` for better debugging
- Docs

### Problems / Ideas:
- ~~Instead of refactoring `OpFromGraph` into 3 classes, how about adding a `inline` parameter to `OpFromGraph`, resulting simpler code?~~
- Made a commit to combine 3 classes back into one single `OpFromGraph`. This is different to the original plan on dividing `OpFromGraph`, but I think this makes the code cleaner. Is this OK?

3307,5267,Minor inconsistency in AbstractConv_gradInput implementations,gvtulder,"I don't know if this is a known problem, but I couldn't find an existing issue.

This [comment](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/94fba3d8f05c65799e21198f845051f82b30416d/keras/layers/convolutional.py#L515-L527) in documentation for the Keras Deconvolution2D layer surprised me, because it suggests that the output shape of Theano `AbstractConv_gradInput` might depend on whether it runs on the GPU or the CPU. This is also discussed in fchollet/keras#3824.

The problem seems to be that if you set `border_mode='half'` and use an odd filter size, the result of `AbstractConv_gradInput` is not clearly defined. It works fine if you give it a gradient tensor that has the same size that you would get from the forward convolution, but if you give it a gradient tensor of a different size the results depend on the implementation. The CorrMM implementations give a different result than the cuDNN function.

These tests illustrate the problem. They fail because the cuDNN results do not match those of the reference implementation. Running them in DebugMode gives an optimization error.

I'm not sure how this problem should be solved, because changing the existing Theano implementations perhaps is not a good idea. However, it is also awkward that the results depend on the environment.",,nouiz f0k lamblin,,2016-11-21 22:18:09,2016-12-19 16:30:36,theano/tensor/nnet/corr3d_gemm.c theano/tensor/nnet/corr.py theano/gpuarray/dnn_gw.c theano/sandbox/cuda/dnn_gw.c theano/sandbox/cuda/dnn_fwd.c theano/gpuarray/dnn.py theano/gpuarray/dnn_gi.c theano/gpuarray/tests/test_abstractconv.py theano/sandbox/cuda/corr_gemm.cu theano/gpuarray/blas.py theano/tensor/nnet/tests/test_abstract_conv.py theano/gpuarray/dnn_fwd.c theano/gpuarray/tests/test_dnn.py theano/sandbox/cuda/blas.py theano/tensor/nnet/corr3d.py theano/gpuarray/corr_gemm.c theano/tensor/nnet/corr_gemm.c theano/sandbox/cuda/dnn_gi.c theano/sandbox/cuda/tests/test_dnn.py theano/gpuarray/corr3d_gemm.c theano/tensor/nnet/abstract_conv.py theano/sandbox/cuda/tests/test_abstractconv.py theano/sandbox/cuda/dnn.py theano/sandbox/cuda/corr3d_gemm.cu,8edcf20781d3cc304f8477c9b91e68e52ec6e893 0e40d582f25a013e50ea1880082327ce5bf595ea e0cdd248a73490d960818e916bd86c2dd9b31a42 771cf248755f6fede67b16953f0b4d54d6a41536 382be8851a76a3038cb4a4f6e2119e0bd7b7fe14 59a172843352d54e221f3a1614d4a672b5a45fdd 676cf29d416839e5d9d0499f47b0af168b394c95 beded2b3c484d4301c3fc14a91b827238e1b4fb8 5caafd990b81fb56233bde803f2e738deb11c435 c655fb734ce5a308c65d51a23e5c856ec19d63b0 5a730afe0209c33c1628c4aa2447f76a566535e0 76b4f47a76b0ba64475112e28847f777e36a0d30 d286cadb9e15ba1e84c34185b59369d58e8bc373 4925a64874c95cbdcb68fd242230f460c64cb276 b0b0f0766d4650c54312c988e2b060abbba14032 65d17342c345d8804d71a351b55333cb178db20d d327e49e24e698d6d3a8d8be820da08ae8e68e7a 193c99799b3b73cd4c463c0f87c6629ae02e0624 30dd8bdc81951522f23d2c4909c3af026ac154ba 65f5ae84ca07b97cb10ece114795db0ec99e594a 297da372b0a371ffbe105f3cd190a064a7a019fc f3398c5960925be6e7e4a0170cafd9f6d6060875 0da931e9578be5b7c577d501b9a3a2603d467901 0a361bbcdf1b9efe7435e47d14f570a64b5b0b2b d01b58395a57cc982da149a3a0eb3e65c18bfbc7 7f1c36774f7c5163cf83790a44df6775244cf5da e8fdf903e256d901fe0da7c2c3360932b6eb86f7 096a782ba2d27a9e9ca2ac9aebcc9b15d0be8b76 2f7e7d923818b9b8e6ff9e5002f78b997cb22671 e685f29276a64b0d55e6dededa0449f8e6a270b7 657986989a171f68ce4c797c5e2e1b8449c86657,"gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-11-22 10:29:35,vdumoulin mentioned 2016-11-24 21:29:47,vdumoulin subscribed 2016-11-24 21:29:47,f0k mentioned 2016-11-24 21:29:47,f0k subscribed 2016-11-24 21:29:47,vdumoulin mentioned 2016-11-25 19:03:45,vdumoulin subscribed 2016-11-25 19:03:45,f0k mentioned 2016-11-25 19:03:45,f0k subscribed 2016-11-25 19:03:45,nouiz milestoned 2016-11-25 20:16:18,lamblin mentioned 2016-11-25 20:20:39,lamblin subscribed 2016-11-25 20:20:39,vdumoulin mentioned 2016-11-25 20:21:27,vdumoulin subscribed 2016-11-25 20:21:27,gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-11-26 01:31:39,gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-11-26 01:32:24,gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-11-30 10:20:54,gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-12-01 14:46:02,gvtulder head_ref_force_pushed 2016-12-13 09:23:53,nouiz referenced 2016-12-19 16:30:36,nouiz merged 2016-12-19 16:30:36,nouiz closed 2016-12-19 16:30:36,gvtulder head_ref_deleted 2016-12-19 16:31:40",gvtulder vdumoulin lamblin f0k nouiz,17,True

3338,5314,Port erfinv and erfcinv to new backend.,notoraptor,"Create GpuErfinv and GpuErfcinv in `theano.gpuarray.elemwise`. These ops currently only works with CUDA (OpenCL does not currently provide `erfinv` and `erfcinv` functions).

Make sure these GPU ops return the same values as CPU (`scipy.special`) equivalent ops. Currently:
* erfinv is defined in `]-1;1[`. CUDA returns `-inf` and `+inf` if input is -1 and 1, and NaN for any other input outside the domain of definition. Scipy returns `-inf` if `input <= -1` and `+inf` if `input >= 1`.
* erfcinv is defined in `]0;2[`. CUDA returns `+inf` and `-inf` if input is 0 and 2, and NaN for any other input outside the domain of definition. Scipy returns `+inf` if `input <= 0` and `-inf` if `input >= 2`.

So, the code adds checkings to ensure that both GPU and CPU ops return the same values, that is currently the Scipy values.

Update optimization to take account of these ops. Optimization is applied only with CUDA device. If OpenCL is used, a warning message is printed and optimization is skipped (Elemwise will not be replaced with GpuElemwise neither erf(c)inv with GpuErf(c)inv).

Add tests. GPU ops are effectively clearly faster than CPU ops, but currently (with 100 000 values as input), still slower than GpuFromHost and HostFromGpu.

3343,5321,unstable commit-fixed perform on gpujoin,ReyhaneAskari,"Hi @nouiz ,
fix #5253 , I tried to apply the same logic for GPU. I fixed the perform function and it seems to work as expected but I can not do the test as before. The reason is that we were checking if the same object is passed to the output. Since the numerical values are converted to ```<type 'pygpu.gpuarray.GpuArray'>```, it can not be compered with a ```numpy array```.  I tried to to give the input as a gpuarray by defining it as a ```shared``` variable but its type is ```<class 'theano.gpuarray.type.GpuArraySharedVariable'>```. I tried to get the ```container``` of the shared variable but : 
```
-> x.container.type 
   GpuArrayType<None>(float32, (False,))
```

How do you think we should test it?

I updated max pool rop implementation which now supports arbitrary ndim for pure python and cpu openmp implementation. I also dropped support for old backend and instead added support only for new backend.

Also as a sidenote, there is a large overlap between max pooling and max pooling rop. Max pooling reduces to max pooling rop if eval point is equal to the input. For now, I didn't do any refactoring and just duplicated code for max pooling with minor changes for rop.

3358,5355,Update checking of integer types. ,notoraptor,"This fixes #5274.

For integer types, any string-based type-checking (like `'int' in dtype`) is now replaced with a list-based type-checking (like `dtype in list`) using the types lists provided in `theano.tensor` (int_dtypes, uint_dtypes, integer_dtypes and discrete_dtypes).

Remarks:
* Module `theano.sparse` have its own types lists, so they are used in that module instead of `theano.tensor` lists.
* The `discrete_dtypes` list (integer types + `bool` type) is the list to use to fix issue #5274 . When replacing string-based checkings I have tried to use that list where it seems relevant (for e.g. in some `grad()` functions) to prevent other future bugs, but I think it should be discussed.

3362,5359,Fix issue #4476 related to BatchedDot.,notoraptor,"fix gh-4476. It is fixed by modifying contiguousity checking in the c_code of BatchedDot. Now the code uses `(PyArray_IS_C_CONTIGUOUS || PyArray_IS_F_CONTIGUOUS)` to do the checking.

Previously the code checked if every stride of the inputs is relevant (strictly positive and multiple of type size) and if at least one of the strides has the size of the type. I think the bug comes from the latter condition, as an array can be not-contiguous even if one stride has the size of the type (for example, a Fortran array in which the first dimension is contiguous but not the last ones).

Remarks:
* I put the test in `test_basic` even if `BatchedDot` is in `blas.py` because the `batched_dot` tests are also in `test_basic`.
* It seems some other codes check the contiguity using the previous conditions, so there is maybe some similar bugs with other ops. For example, we may have to check the Dot22 op: https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/tensor/blas.py#L603

3370,5385,Bug: gradient of ifelse with gpu inputs,gvtulder,"There is a problem with the `IfElse` gradient when the inputs are on the GPU. There's a small example below. If you compute the gradient of such an `IfElse`, the [`grad` method](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/ifelse.py#L220-L227) will construct two new `IfElse` nodes. For these new nodes, one branch will get the gradient (a GPU tensor), while the other branch gets a new variable created with `tensor.zeros_like`. Because that is not a GPU tensor, the `IfElse` will complain that the types of the return values are not the same:
```
TypeError: ('IfElse requires same types for true and false return values',
    GpuFromHost<None>.0, Elemwise{second,no_inplace}.0,
    GpuArrayType<None>(float32, (False,)), TensorType(float32, vector))

Partial example script:
```python
x = tensor.vector('x')
y = tensor.vector('y')
c = tensor.iscalar('c')

x_gpu = basic_ops.as_gpuarray_variable(x, test_ctx_name)
y_gpu = basic_ops.as_gpuarray_variable(y, test_ctx_name)

out = theano.ifelse.ifelse(c, x_gpu, y_gpu)
theano.grad(out.sum(), [x, y])

The c_code_cache_version() of GpuArrayType now depends on gpuarray ABI version instead of API version, so that cached files linked with an old gpuarray shared library will be recompiled every time the gpuarray ABI version changes.

3384,5412,Fix theano scripts on windows,notoraptor,"Use the entry_points/console_scripts feature of `setup.py` to make theano scripts installed when running `pip install`.

These step are done to fix #5308. The bin folder containing the scripts is now importable from Python, with each script embedding its code into a `main()` function specified as the entry point of the script in `setup.py`.

We have also reported on issue #5308 a Windows-specific error related to theano-cache: the cache folder cannot be deleted because it contains some shared libraries that are always loaded at theano importation and stay opened on Windows, which forbide the deletion of these shared library files in the cache.

The workaround chosen is to unset the theano config flag `cxx` only on Windows platform and only in theano-cache script. Doing that, Theano will not try to compile any C code, and will also not try to load compiled C codes that are in the cache, allowing these files to be deleted.

To ensure this workaround does work, we also ensure that lazylinker module will be also ignored from the cache when `cxx` is unset. Previously, if cxx was unset, Theano would not compile lazylinker but would look for an already compiled version of this module in the cache.

The installation (`pip install -e .`) works on my computer (with conda, tested with Python 2.7.13) and the installed theano scripts (now with `.exe` extension) also.

Can anyone else test this PR on a windows machine ?

3391,5427,Add user warning to prevent issue #5143,notoraptor,"This does not fix #5143 but helps user prevent this issue.

For 3D convolutions, cuDNN currently provides 2 algorithms to compute backward filter step: algo 0 (`CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_FILTER_ALGO_0`) and algo 3 (`CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_FILTER_ALGO_3`). In theano unit tests, when theano flag `dnn.conv.algo_bwd_filter` is set to `none`, then algo 0 is always chosen and produces the expected results. But for other values of this flag, which let cuDNN choose either the best or the fatest algorithm, then algo 3 may be selected. After investigation, it seems that algo 3 can produce values very far from the expected ones depending on the shapes of the input and the compute capability of the GPU used. For example, with compute capability of 3.0, 3.5 or 3.7, there is no error, but with compute capability of 5.2 or 6.1, the errors do occur.

The following table shows some results. Here's the theano test used:
```
THEANO_FLAGS=floatX=float32,dnn.conv.algo_bwd_filter=guess_on_shape_change nosetests -sdvx theano.sandbox.cuda.tests.test_dnn:test_conv3d_bwd
```
And here's the table:

This fix just prints a warning when the user sets the theano flag `dnn.conv.algo_bwd_filter` to value other than `none` and tell him to set it to `none` if he encounters some unexpected results.

It is a non-blocking error (the cache will be indeed purged with `theano-cache purge`), but just to not print this error, I modified the `theano-cache` script which will now force `device=cpu` just for its execution (as `theano-cache` has nothing to do with the GPU).

3424,5479,(small fix) Ensure Theano finds libgpuarray folders automatically in Windows with conda package,notoraptor,"( this is related to windows documentation PR #5433 )

Theano uses `distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc()` to get Python headers folder (and a similar function for libraries folder), and on Windows it returns the `include` folder located inside the environment folder (e.g. `C:\\donnees\\programmes\\Anaconda3\\envs\\python2\\include` (PS: same value is returned when calling ` distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc(plat_specific=True)`)).

But conda installs the `libgpuarray` package under a folder named `Library` inside the environment folder (e.g. `C:\\donnees\\programmes\\Anaconda3\\envs\\python2\\Library\\include\\gpuarray`). It seems this `Library` folder is specific to Windows, so that it is impossible to get it directly from Python.

This fix ensures that the `Library` folder on Windows is used to find libgpuarray headers and static libraries automatically, so that user has nothing more to do when installing libgpuarray through conda.

Then the windows documentation will not need anything related to ""configure libgpuarray"" or something like that.

3425,5480,(small fix) Add new internal config flag `cuda.disable` to help disable compilation in old backend,notoraptor,"Currently the old backend is imported sometimes just to do some type checking, but when imported, it will try to compile some C code if it finds `nvcc`, and the compilation in old backend also needs the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (`cl.exe`).

On Windows, the CUDA_ROOT contains both `nvcc` and CUDA DLL files that are required for the new backend, so that `nvcc` will be always visible in the environment, but `cl.exe` will not be always installed or visible (and the new Windows Installation documentation will not tell to install Visual C++).

Then, on Windows, this can lead to an useless compilation error, which is non-blocking, but prints about 5000 lines of C code + some annoying error messages.

This PR suggests a new flag `cuda.disable` which may be used to disable compilation in old backend. I use it in the function `is_nvcc_available()`, which now immediately returns false when `cuda.disable` is set to `true`.

That's because the C code for `gpuarray/pool` expects ws, strides and pads to be convertible to `npy_intp`. But `npy_intp` can be either 32 or 64 bits depending on the machine, and these inputs generally contain default integers that are also either 32 or 64 bits.

This PR makes sure these inputs are casted to `int64` in Python code and used as `int64` in all related C codes.

I resolved it by reducing the size of test values from 10 000 000 to 10 000. We initially use a big size to check if GPU is faster than CPU on big data, but I think it is not really useful for simple unit testing.

This test checks that the length of the function graph is exactly 2 when ignoring a list of operations. On GPU the ignored operations are `HostFromGpu, GpuFromHost, DeepCopyOp, GpuContiguous` ( https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/gpuarray/tests/test_subtensor.py#L39 ). But the function graph (defined here: https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/tensor/tests/test_subtensor.py#L110 ) looks like this on my computer:
```
HostFromGpu(gpuarray) [id A] ''   4
 |GpuAdvancedSubtensor1 [id B] ''   3
   |<GpuArrayType<None>(float64, (False, False, False))> [id C]
   |GpuContiguous [id D] ''   2
     |GpuElemwise{Cast{int64}}[]<gpuarray> [id E] ''   1
       |GpuSubtensor{::int64} [id F] ''   0
         |<GpuArrayType<None>(int32, (False,))> [id G]
         |Constant{2} [id H]
```
So there are 3 operations counted when we let the ignored ones: `GpuAdvancedSubtensor1`, `GpuElemwise{Cast{int64}}` and `GpuSubtensor{::int64}`. Then, it is the cast{int64} op that seems extra. Indeed, it seems it is created here: https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/gpuarray/subtensor.py#L414 :
```
        if ilist__.type.dtype != 'int64':
            ilist__ = tensor.cast(ilist__, 'int64')
```
So it is certainly (again) because index list is `int32` on Windows.

To fix it, I have just updated the creation of index list in the test, by casting it to `int64` before it is passed to `make_node()`, as it is the test only that checks the number of ops (it should not be a real use-case).

I'm looking for some last other bugs, so I will update this PR tomorrow (unit tests take much time to run on my computer!).

3480,5612,Implement a struct generator for wrapping op params in Python and C codes.,notoraptor,"According to @abergeron guidelines, this PR proposes an implementation of a struct generator that allows to pack many Theano variables into one object and make them accessible from both `perform()` and `c_code()` methods of ops. The generator is intended to be used to create param ops.

I have much work to do again (_re-read the code, check if it can be simplified or if I have forgotten some things, check if I can write hash methods differently, make more tests and extend the current unit testing_), but I think the current code can already be reviewed to check if the global design and the global ideas are suitable ! Also, I don't really know where to put the new class, so I have created a new module called `theano.common` (as this generator could be used in all other modules), but I can move it elsewhere if needed.

There is currently a working unit test, and a small ""tutorial"" at the top of the generator implementation.

3488,5631,Faster compilation and import with cuda backend,f0k,"This partly solves the problem identified in https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/1681#issuecomment-283022286 of GPU Ops taking much longer to compile than CPU Ops.

The problem is that a `mod.cu` file goes through `cudafe` and `cudafe++`, which takes a whopping 1.5 seconds of compile time even for an empty file. Many GPU Ops don't actually need that: If an Op doesn't require compiling any kernels, there's no point in calling `cudafe`. The simple solution is to rename such files to `mod.cpp` instead, and manually add the `cuda.h` and `cuda_runtime_api.h` headers.

This PR is a proof of concept. I'm not sure the distinction code catches all cases, but it works for me.
On my machine, `import theano` takes 2.5s before this PR, and 0.7s after (with an existing compile directory, not from scratch).
Compiling the Lasagne MNIST example with the CNN architecture from an empty compile directory takes 2m45s before this PR, and 1m38s after. Before this PR, it produces 34 `mod.cpp` files and 70 `mod.cu` files. After this PR, it produces 71 `mod.cpp` files and 33 `mod.cu` files.

Now what do we do with this? I know the backend is meant to be dropped any time soon (before or after releasing 0.9?), so it's probably more of a ""why didn't we do this 5 years ago"" suggestion, but maybe there is a chance to backport this to Theano 0.8.2 and have a final maintenance release with it, for people who need to use the old backend for some reason? Finally, is any of this relevant for the new backend? On my machine, it takes even longer to import than the old backend, but I don't see any nvcc process involved.",,nouiz lamblin,,2017-02-28 14:12:01,2017-03-06 13:49:02,theano/configdefaults.py theano/sandbox/cuda/nvcc_compiler.py,0dfc7a511600c8f738b39d91d1bb5466b499f4a5,"f0k head_ref_force_pushed 2017-02-28 14:34:26,abergeron mentioned 2017-02-28 15:59:47,abergeron subscribed 2017-02-28 15:59:47,nouiz milestoned 2017-02-28 21:20:24,lamblin mentioned 2017-02-28 21:20:53,lamblin subscribed 2017-02-28 21:20:53,f0k head_ref_force_pushed 2017-03-05 15:33:35,f0k head_ref_force_pushed 2017-03-05 18:49:48,nouiz referenced 2017-03-06 13:49:01,nouiz merged 2017-03-06 13:49:01,nouiz closed 2017-03-06 13:49:02,f0k head_ref_deleted 2017-03-06 13:52:09",abergeron nouiz f0k lamblin,9,True

3493,5640,Numpy module imported twice #4218,Amrithasuresh,"Hi,

I committed changes for this issue https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/4218.

This is my first time to github contribution.

As per your suggestion in this page https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/4218

I did following things

1) converted ""import numpy as N"" to ""import numpy as np""
2) change ""import numpy"" to ""import numpy as np""
3) Made one commit per file.
4) I did manually. I have not used sed or anything automated.
5) I did not touch any c code.

Hope this helps. Thank you.

@f0k How bad you think that we don't assert user shape by default? @abergeron point of view is that this is more for debugging purpose. We won't generate bad results. It would just put back the user shape as compiler hint as it was done in some of the ops (while others was enforcing it). We will be consistent between all ops.

3525,5710,Implement new op param type `EnumType`,notoraptor,"This PR suggests a new abstract attribute `enum` added into COp to define enumerations of constants that will be automatically converted into C macros by `COp.get_op_params()` method.

This should help to reduce C code of some C-ops, for example with GpuDnnSoftmax, as we could then define a fixed-list of constants (that won't change from an op instance to another), and then use an op param that takes a runtime value within this list of constants.

The PR also adds two functions to help create enums quickly, and a test for this new feature.

3530,5718,Prepare final release 0.9.0.,notoraptor,"Few remarks:
 * I have moved old content of `NEWS.txt` into `HISTORY.txt`. New content of `NEWS.txt` is the old from `NEWS_DEV.txt` with corrections and updates from last PRs since 0.9.0rc4.
 * Last version for flag `warn.ignore_bug_before` is `0.9`, but I use `0.9.0` to name this new release. Is it a problem ?
 * In `LICENSE.txt`, Theano copyright year was already updated in previous PRs, but copyright years for NumPy and NVIDIA are still  previous years (2015, 2016). Should I update them also ?
* There was a line in section ""new features"" of NEWS_DEV: `conv3d2d support full and half mode (REMOVE?)`. I have moved it to section ""convolution updates"" and rewritten it : `Support of full and half modes for 2D and 3D convolutions`.

This PR depends on:
 * PR for Wrapper that allows to make structs: #5612
 * PR for EnumType that allows to create constants: #5710 

Here I update these PRs with some fixes, improvements and adjustments, and I finally use op params for `GpuDnnSoftmaxBase`, `GpuDnnSoftmax` and `GpuDnnSoftmaxGrad`. To help see differences with the other PRs, all these changes are in one commit (the current last): https://github.com/notoraptor/Theano/commit/6b204315c85ae41fb3abbdeb8668b3560864dad2 .

*Summary of changes added by this PR*:

 1) Fix conversion from integers to C enum in C code for Theano enum types.

2) Update Wrapper with new convenient methods to ease wrapping dicts and objects.

3) Update Wrapper interface to handle Theano enum types. Enum constants from enum types wrapped into a Wrapper are directly available as wrapper attributes. Add a convenient method ``Wrapper.get_enum(enum_name)`` to get enum constants by name.

4) Add a test to check Wrapper+enum interface.

5) Update Wrapper documentation.

6) Update default ``Op.get_params()`` implementation to use new Wrapper convenient methods.

7) **Add Op param to GpuDnnSoftmaxBase**

8) **Update C code for ``GpuDnnSoftmax`` and ``GpuDnnSoftmaxGrad``**.

3543,5758,Add sigmoid_binary_crossentropy function,jeffdonahue,"This adds a function `sigmoid_binary_crossentropy(pred, target)` which does the same computation (mathematically) as `binary_crossentropy(sigmoid(pred), target)`, but in a stabler and hopefully slightly more efficient way.  The gradient with respect to `pred` can be computed in a particularly elegant and simple way relative to how Theano currently computes the gradients (even with graph optimizations). See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jeffdonahue/b0641bafc2df22d7bd46d953dd89ef0e) for a comparison of the computation graphs each one produces, and [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jeffdonahue/84eab3b74db5309da871a5abb78bdde6) for a comparison of numerical errors: relative to `binary_crossentropy`, in `FAST_RUN` mode, this version reduces numerical error (MSE) on standard Gaussian inputs by ~18% in the cross-entropy computation, ~43% for the gradient w.r.t. `pred`, and >99% for the gradient w.r.t. `target`.  (In `FAST_COMPILE` mode the error reductions are bigger.)

One almost always has access to the real-valued predictions before they are passed through `sigmoid` to produce probabilties in `(0, 1)`.  In those cases,`sigmoid_binary_crossentropy(p, t)` should be preferred over `binary_crossentropy(sigmoid(p), t)`.

This might be possible to do solely via graph optimization, and if so that would be preferable to having to make people update their code to use this new function (with an admittedly less clean interface), but I spent a while trying to make that work through pattern replacement and couldn't get there.  (I was very happy when I discovered the `inline` and `grad_overrides` kwargs for `OpFromGraph`, which is what's used here instead of graph optimization -- it was exactly what I'd been looking for to implement this and a couple other things.  Thanks @khaotik and reviewers of #5255!)

If this is potentially worth merging, I'm open to any suggested changes (including to the name of the function, which I'm not too happy with).  Otherwise if nothing else it could be a good example of using `OpFromGraph` with `grad_overrides`.",,lamblin,,2017-03-23 20:15:06,2017-05-01 20:57:33,theano/tensor/nnet/tests/test_nnet.py theano/tensor/nnet/nnet.py theano/tensor/nnet/__init__.py doc/library/tensor/nnet/nnet.txt,d30ff49e2ac950a99fe807ff0b0611b06a98ae11 e8d9bed52bd1617075e8e0c0832e6df738e314d8,"khaotik mentioned 2017-03-23 20:15:06,khaotik subscribed 2017-03-23 20:15:06,jeffdonahue head_ref_force_pushed 2017-03-23 23:36:51,jeffdonahue head_ref_force_pushed 2017-03-24 04:15:17,lamblin mentioned 2017-04-04 15:50:52,lamblin subscribed 2017-04-04 15:50:52,jeffdonahue head_ref_force_pushed 2017-04-04 20:00:49,nouiz mentioned 2017-04-04 20:02:14,nouiz subscribed 2017-04-04 20:02:14,lamblin mentioned 2017-04-04 20:47:40,lamblin subscribed 2017-04-04 20:47:40,nouiz mentioned 2017-04-04 20:47:40,nouiz subscribed 2017-04-04 20:47:40,lamblin mentioned 2017-04-26 17:34:28,lamblin subscribed 2017-04-26 17:34:28,lamblin referenced 2017-05-01 20:57:33,lamblin merged 2017-05-01 20:57:33,lamblin closed 2017-05-01 20:57:33,lamblin mentioned 2017-05-02 02:33:48,lamblin subscribed 2017-05-02 02:33:48",khaotik lamblin nouiz jeffdonahue,6,True

If I change np to numpy in the file (except numpy.distutils. parts). At line :136:5: flake gives error F401 'numpy' imported but unused. What should I do here? The below line shows flake error. So, I didn't the blas.py file. 

try:
    import numpy.distutils.__config__
except ImportError:
    pass

Commited changes in few files for this issue https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/4218.

3559,5796,"Print compilation count for all compiled Op classes with ""theano-cache list"" command",notoraptor,"Currently, command `theano-cache list` skips modules that contains more than 1 Op. This does not help to track variations in compilation counts when we want to reduce C code procuded by Theano.

This PR updates the printing so that the number of compilations is printed for ALL compiled Op classes, and not only for individual compiled Op classes as it is currenty.

I have also updated `repr(GpuArrayType)` so that it looks more like `repr(TensorType)` (e.g. when `(False, False)` is replace with `matrix`), to help reduce length of printed lines.

@nouiz @lamblin .


**PS**: Example of printing with this PR. I am working on `GpuImages2Neibs`. As I have reduced its C code, it does not appear anymore in list of individual Ops at top of printing (because many different Op instances are associated to only 1 C module code from now). With this PR, I can see compilation count for this class in the second printed list.

**Notes**:
 * For Python requirements, the first sentence is now adapted to the OS. It recommends python-dev(el) packages for Linux/CentOS, and conda distribution for Windows and Mac (I don't know if python-dev(el) packages exist on Mac).
 * BLAS requirements now recommend `mkl-service` conda package, but OpenBLAS ""dev"" packages are still mentionned for all OS. I currently don't know how to add/remove conditionnally a list entry in a reST file.
 * ""sudo"" terms are still present. It may be hard to make them appear only in Linux documentations.
 * I have added a warning about conda installation for last versions of theano and pygpu, to tell that these packages currently don't support Python 3.4 branch. I had made the remark in the previous PR: https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/5433#issuecomment-288792237 . It seems it is related to limitations of libgpuarray package, which is available only for Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6.

For the op lifter, as only 2 cases are implemented in gpu_solve (general using LU decomposition and symmetric using cholesky) I considered that if the user requires a solve op for another case, it would be more efficient to keep it on the cpu, than to move it to the gpu using the general LU case.

3619,5927,Partially factorize GpuKernelBase.get_params() and configure it to use ParamsType.,notoraptor,"This PR adds a part of work done in #5866 , to help reduce the size of that (big) PR, prevent some future problems with ParamsType, and reduce size of Theano code:

 - Add default `GpuKernelBase.get_params()` that retrieves GPU context from first node input type, and then factorize `get_params()` for all sub-classes that retrieve context by this way. Method `get_params()` must be overridden for any subclass that gets context by different way. This proposal helps remove some lines of Theno Python code.
 - Extend GpuKernelBase interface to allow sub-classes to use parameters types other than `gpu_context_type` (especially `ParamsType`). This helps prevent problems when some subclasses of GpuKernelBase will be rewritten with a ParamsType as params type (done in #5866 ).

3623,5936,Add support for cudnn v6 dilated convolution.,HapeMask,"Addresses the first part of #5734.

The old ""upscale"" parameter to ```cudnnSetConvolutionNdDescriptor``` is now the dilation parameter, but coincidentally everything worked fine from v5->v6 since the default value passed was {1,1,1}. I just added some code to properly set it from the python side. Only the IMPLICIT_GEMM algorithm supports dilation but the existing code already falls back to this if the user's algo choice isn't valid.

As a small anecdote, I patched Lasagne to use Theano's AbstractConv2D interface for dilated conv as well and compared the performance.

So, This PR updates the warnings conditions:
 - Show warnings only if floatX==float32.
 - Show warnings only for cuDNN prior to v6.

3632,5949,Baidu CTC wrapper,joaovictortr,"Fix and adapt an existing wrapper for [Baidu CTC](https://github.com/mcf06/theano_ctc), then integrate it into tensor.nnet.

If the [warp-ctc](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc) library is not on the compiler's default library path, one should set the ```ctc.root``` variable to point to a local copy of the aforementioned library.

Before executing the CTC wrapepr, it is necessary to have the library libwarpctc.so on the LD path, so one also has to change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the directory that contains the library.

For example:
```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CTC_LIB/build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
THEANO_FLAGS=`floatX=float32,ctc.root=/home/user/warp-ctc' python theano/tensor/nnet/tests/test_ctc.py
``` 

Tasks:

- [x] Port CPU implementation (done using a COp)
- [x] Add tests and verification of results for CPU implementation (test done, more test cases required)
- [x] CPU to GPU optimization
- [x] Fix and port GPUOp to new backend
- [x] Add tests and verification of results for GPU implementation
- [x] Use OpenMP in CPU wrapper
- [x] Use CUDA stream in GPU wrapper

3638,5964,Wrap Op params for many gpuarray DNN Ops and add cuDNN v6 integration.,notoraptor,"This PR adds and extends a lot of work done in #5866 . ParamsType is now used for many gpuarray DNN ops, and cuDNN v6 integration is extended.

Ops currently rewritten in this PR:

 - GpuDnnConvDesc
 - GpuDnnConv
 - GpuDnnConvGradW
 - GpuDnnConvGradI
 - GpuDnnPool
 - GpuDnnPoolGrad
 - GpuDnnBatchNormInference
 - GpuDnnBatchNormGrad

cuDNN v6 integration:

 - Support MAX DETERMINISTIC algorithm for GpuDnnPool with cuDNN v6.
 - Update pooling tests for DNN module so that they use the available algorithms depending on runtime cuDNN version.
 - Allow CPU Pool and PoolGrad ops to use MAX_DETERMINISTIC algo when cuDNN v6 is used with GPU counterparts.
 - Encapsulate cuDNN constants used in DNN module, to help choose the right cuDNN definitions depending on the runtime cuDNN version. Currently supported cuDNN versions: v5.1, v6.0. Encapsulation is done in module `cudnn_defs.py`.

Next steps:
 - Add a new tests file to do exhaustive tests on gpuarray DNN ops. I had created a separate PR for that, but maybe I will have to either continue this work here (in this PR), or wait for this PR to be merged first.
 - Check if I can/must add other specific checkings that depend on cuDNN version (e.g. check if an algorithm chosen at runtime can be really applied on current inputs).
 - Check if I can also rewrite GpuDnnBatchnorm (maybe in another PR). This op is a little hard to rewrite because I can't convert some macros (used in C code) to params.

Here I wrap op params for **`theano.tensor.nnet.corr.BaseCorrMM`** and sub-classes (I had already done it for Corr**3d**MM in a previous PR).

@nouiz not sure if this could answer your previous question about Corr**3d**MM, but I have run a simple benchmark to compare execution time before and after using op params.

Benchmark:
```bash

So, execution time was drastically reduced (537.712s -> 184.602s) !

Also, compiled classes (`theano-cache list`) before:
```

<class 'theano.compile.ops.Shape_i'> 4

<class 'theano.tensor.nnet.corr.CorrMM_gradWeights'> 44
<class 'theano.tensor.nnet.corr.CorrMM'> 77
```
And compiled classes after:
```
List of 9 compiled Op classes and the number of times they got compiled
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<class 'theano.tensor.opt.MakeVector'> 1
<class 'theano.tensor.elemwise.DimShuffle'> 1

<class 'theano.compile.ops.Shape_i'> 4
<class 'theano.tensor.elemwise.Elemwise'> 14
```

Number of compilations for corr.* classes were reduced as we expect (44 to 77 -> only 3 compilations for each op).

Currently, I have added two tests to reproduce the problem: one with 10 000 as batch size, and another with 70 000 as batch size (all other parameters are identical). Then the test with 70 000 inputs fails (see console output below).

Currently, I don't think that the problem is about strides or dimensions, as all these values for current tested inputs may be handled by a system integer (`int`). Still investigating.

I can not reproduce the problem (with Python 3), maybe because test values are randomly chosen, but I think increasing the rtol to 1e-3 should help tests to pass, as results compare `matrix * matrix inverse` with `np.eye()`.

3697,6079,[Intel MKL] implement high performance convolution OP,pengzhao-intel,"This PR is for the implementations of Intel MKL-based Convolution OP, regarding our previous discussion in [#5580](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/5580) and [PR5770](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/5770) and [PR6016](https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/6016).

In this PR, both data layout conversion and convolution computation OPs are included.
BTW, the MKLNdarray code is duplicated so we can continuously track it in 5770 separately.

**Data layout conversion OPs (in file basic_ops.py):**
- BaseConvertOp(MKLOp): base layer for all data conversion OP
- U2IConv(BaseConvertOp): change the user layout (numpy array) to MKLNdarray for convolution layers
- I2U(BaseConvertOp): change the MKLNdarray to user layout (numpy array) and this OP can work for any MKL outputs (such as convolution, relu, pool)  
- U2IGrad(BaseConvertOp): it's for backward computation of U2I and actually it's equal with I2U in functionality
- I2UGrad(BaseConvertOp): MKLNdarry to numpy layout translation for backward computation

**Convolution OPs (in file mkl_conv.py):**

3700,6083,Added the tri-gamma function.,botev,"I've added the Tri-gamma function, which can be run on the GPU as well in comparison to #5963.

Note that I'm not too sure how you guys want to keep the name as the digamma function in Theano is named psi. 
As a note I'm aware of some efforts of doing the more general poly-gamma function, however, this requires a lot more effort and debugging of CUDA kernels as in #4198 which I can not do.
The implementation C code was taken from http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/asa121/asa121.html

As a side note if the `polygamma` makes it into to Theano you might want for `k=0` and `k=1` the Theano interface to return the `Psi` and `TriGamma` Ops, this might simplify the interface significantly.

The standard lgtm engineering analytics highlights dependencies, vulnerabilities and tracks introduced and fixed alerts as the code changes (and shows that [Theano keeps getting better](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/Theano/Theano/)). There are currently [295 alerts](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/Theano/Theano/alerts/) flagged, probably better investigated by someone more familiar with the code base than me, but you can also investigate further by writing [your own custom queries](https://lgtm.com/docs/ql/about-ql) to explore your code base.

I personally find lgtm alerts most useful when using [PR integration](https://lgtm.com/docs/lgtm/config/pr-integration) as it allows to check and deal with potential issues before they find their way into master (see for instance [12ff9ab](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/Theano/Theano/rev/12ff9ab5867d83fc9b92c926fd9d774c55c4047a)).

- I have implemented tensor_op setting for Volta which seems to work. This should be extended to try fp16 HMMA - in the next cycle.

A larger chunk of changes is about algo cache. I am happy with the refactoring part - it works. Actual caching is disabled as It still needs work, I am looking for your help:
1. Shape string generation needs to be fixed
2. Alignment part of the hash key should be added (from C code?)
3. device id needs to be added to the hash key, as well as fwd/bwd_filter/bwd_data selector.

PR #6283 is currently a Work In Progress, and is not currently safe because it contains some unconditional codes for cuDNN 7 in `dnn.py` (e.g. `cudnnMathType_t`, so that cuDNN V6 can not work). So, I have only taken the minimal changes required to make cuDNN V7 work. I think we should wait for #6283 to reach a safer state before integrating more cuDNN V7 stuffs.

3810,6301,Support NumPy 1.13,notoraptor,"fix #6217 .

NumPy versions prior to 1.13 should print a `FutureWarning` when a comparaison `array == None` is done:
```
(test) C:\\Users\\notoraptor\\mila\\dev\\git\\theano>python -c ""import numpy; print(numpy.__version__); a = numpy.arange(10); print(a == None)""
1.12.1
-c:1: FutureWarning: comparison to `None` will result in an elementwise object comparison in the future.
False
```

So, as a first check, I looked for `FutureWarning` into a previous successful CI testing, in both Jenkins and Travis:
- http://earlgrey.iro.umontreal.ca:8080/job/Theano_PR/616/console
- https://travis-ci.org/Theano/Theano/builds/263080988

As results:
- There are no `FutureWarning` messages in Jenkins console output.
- There are 4 `FutureWarning` messages in Travis tests, but all come frome SciPy (not Theano), via the same test `theano.sparse.tests.test_basic:Test_getitem.test_GetItem2D`. These are related Travis log files:
  - https://travis-ci.org/Theano/Theano/jobs/263080993
  - https://travis-ci.org/Theano/Theano/jobs/263080994
  - https://travis-ci.org/Theano/Theano/jobs/263081005
  - https://travis-ci.org/Theano/Theano/jobs/263081006

And I don't find any `== None`, `!= None`, `None ==` or `None !=` in Theano code. So, it seems that comparison `array == None` is not currently used in Theano.

What I suggest is to run Travis with NumPy 1.13, and then check if some errors occur. This PR contains a temporar commit that should install NumPy 1.13 for Travis tests. Let's see if all tests pass.

3830,6348,Add DEBUG infos to profile cuDNN convolutions.,notoraptor,"This PR adds profiling in C DEBUG mode for cuDNN convolutions.

Currently, profiling is added only for `dnn_fwd`, but I am not sure if current code efficiently measures execution time. Even with `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1`, some executions take `0 milliseconds` (see below).

I have added a special test class (`TestDnnConv2DRuntimeAlgorithmsWithBigInputs`) to test with ""big"" shapes so that we can expect more computation time. Here is the result (tested on Windows 10 64 bits with cuDNN V7, flag `cmodule.debug=True` and `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1`):

So, `f2()` reuses the algorithm cached by `f1()` but then fails with a `CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM`. The only difference between `f1()` and `f2()` is the data type configuration (true half config for `f1()`, pseudo half config for `f2()`).

Then, if we run the same code but with `f2()` before `f1()`, everything works:

We can remark that the worksizw (which is cached with the algorithm) computed by `f1()` (true half config) is 0, but the one computed by `f2()` (pseudo half config) is 1920. As the first called function puts its found algorithm to the cache, that means the second may try to use this algorithm with the associated worksize. But it seems worksize can vary depending on data type configuration, which may make the second called function fail if cached worksize is smaller than the worksize she needs.

To fix it, this PR suggests to add data type configuration to the algorithm hash. There may be other solutions, but I don't yet find a better one.

What do you think ? @nouiz @abergeron @borisfom 

Some remarks:
- We can't currently add the worksize itself to the hash, because we must compute the hash to look for the algorithm in the cache, but we must look for the algorithm in the cache and fail to find it before getting a new algorithm and then computing required worksize.
- Another solution may be to not add worksize to the cache. But I don't know if getting worksize is an expensive computation.",,nouiz,,2017-08-24 16:01:11,2017-08-24 20:15:49,theano/gpuarray/c_code/dnn_gi.c theano/gpuarray/c_code/dnn_gw.c theano/gpuarray/tests/test_dnn.py theano/gpuarray/c_code/dnn_conv_base.c theano/gpuarray/c_code/dnn_fwd.c,a66b878f551d7006a06a0df298cb2380d4e1eae8 bcff31c92a6f9a8e7ca509cf90497a55b2faafd4,"nouiz mentioned 2017-08-24 16:01:11,nouiz subscribed 2017-08-24 16:01:11,abergeron mentioned 2017-08-24 16:01:11,abergeron subscribed 2017-08-24 16:01:11,borisfom mentioned 2017-08-24 16:01:11,borisfom subscribed 2017-08-24 16:01:11,notoraptor mentioned 2017-08-24 19:50:42,notoraptor subscribed 2017-08-24 19:50:43,notoraptor mentioned 2017-08-24 19:56:24,notoraptor subscribed 2017-08-24 19:56:24,borisfom mentioned 2017-08-24 20:15:34,borisfom subscribed 2017-08-24 20:15:34,nouiz referenced 2017-08-24 20:15:49,nouiz merged 2017-08-24 20:15:49,nouiz closed 2017-08-24 20:15:49,notoraptor head_ref_deleted 2017-08-25 15:11:14",abergeron nouiz notoraptor borisfom,10,True

3837,6357,Check shapes of spatial transform theta parameters,gvtulder,"Hi @joaovictortr. Thanks for making the spatial transform from cuDNN available. I have a small suggestion for the size check of the `theta` parameter. The current test checks the second and third dimensions, but doesn't check if the number of rows in `theta` is the same as the number of rows in the input. This patch would change the shape check to make sure that the number of rows in `theta` matches the input shape.

---

If `theta` is shorter than the input, the cuDNN function will currently return random values for all the inputs that fall outside `theta`'s range. Here's an example:

Test fails as soon as beta is not null.

After investigations, it appears that functions called to choose fastest algorithm at runtime (ie., `cudnnFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithmEx()`, `cudnnFindConvolutionBackwardFilterAlgorithmEx()` and `cudnnFindConvolutionBackwardDataAlgorithmEx()`) may actually write arbitrary values on the output memory they receive (`*output`, `*kerns` and `*input`). This is mentionned in the cuDNN documentation. But, when beta is not null, this output memory should be reused later to compute ultimate output (`final_output = alpha * computed_output + beta * given_output`). So, when timed algorithm selection is executed, output memory may be overwritten with unexpected values.

This PR tries to fix this issue by providing a new allocated output memory for timed algorithm selection only if beta is not null.

This was discussed briefly in #6387 

IMO there are three things to fix:

- test `test_Zoom_gradient_single_channel_factor_2`  fails, most likely the way gradient is computed is wrong 
- The operator accepts two tensors, and will zoom the first tensor so that it has the same shape than the second. It would be better if the operator accepts a tensor and a resize factor/resize shape. I implemented it in the first way because it was the easiest given my limited knowledge of Theano, but we should be able to fix that pretty easily.
- interpolation order is hardcoded to 0, expose it as parameter

If one of two approaches turn out to be better/faster/more readable/more whatever, quite a bit of code can be reused and a refactoring might be advisable.",,lamblin abergeron notoraptor nouiz,,2017-09-10 21:45:00,2017-10-13 20:20:08,theano/gpuarray/rng_mrg.py theano/sandbox/rng_mrg.py theano/gpuarray/multinomial.py theano/sandbox/tests/test_rng_mrg.py,1b750f2daa71d28ca6ac6a4362e4acff4d5742a6 cbf2bf513fcc1ac26b6dd4aff0b7aa3c464bbe88 949d78c66aa9694789baba3598fff5b6c825eb26 f454ca19db4f211c0869cf8b6f0c25064edf86b3 e29586c99d19f443ae1e9e131bc41904cb56e98c bd594156c2eff4b00fee32230f3e051284dc5f4e 66b87609fffcc90ebe51959ecbe022328638e40c 7af6be4698f4c93f5bd25fc34750da6ba59fcf35 becd94f2fa6910538f4f36ef3103fba107224d16,"lamblin mentioned 2017-09-13 14:30:36,lamblin subscribed 2017-09-13 14:30:36,abergeron mentioned 2017-09-13 14:30:36,abergeron subscribed 2017-09-13 14:30:36,lamblin milestoned 2017-09-18 20:47:00,lamblin mentioned 2017-10-05 16:57:05,lamblin subscribed 2017-10-05 16:57:05,nouiz mentioned 2017-10-06 20:41:12,nouiz subscribed 2017-10-06 20:41:12,nouiz mentioned 2017-10-09 18:17:35,nouiz subscribed 2017-10-09 18:17:35,nouiz mentioned 2017-10-10 14:43:48,nouiz subscribed 2017-10-10 14:43:48,nouiz mentioned 2017-10-10 14:53:50,nouiz subscribed 2017-10-10 14:53:50,nouiz mentioned 2017-10-10 21:06:41,nouiz subscribed 2017-10-10 21:06:41,nouiz mentioned 2017-10-12 20:54:41,nouiz subscribed 2017-10-12 20:54:41,nouiz referenced 2017-10-13 20:20:08,nouiz merged 2017-10-13 20:20:08,nouiz closed 2017-10-13 20:20:08",mrTsjolder lamblin abergeron notoraptor nouiz,42,True

3909,6492,Fix invalid casts and index overflows in signal.Pool,rebecca-palmer,"signal.Pool currently does

int32 = \\*(int64\\*)(ws,stride,pad, which may be int32 or int64 arrays)

When ws/stride/pad are int32, this is a strict aliasing violation (i.e. technically undefined behaviour; it currently appears to work [unless you're using unusual hardware](https://bugs.debian.org/878596), but might not always).

It also uses int32 indices, which is a possible index-overflow crash if the input array is very large (though I don't have enough RAM to actually test this).

This fixes both those problems.  It passes tensor/signal/tests, but I haven't tried a full test run.

Speed test - tensor/signal/tests/test_pool.py:TestDownsampleFactorMax.test_pooling_with_tensor_vars with the size increased to 10x10x500x500:
current - 88.2, 58.8, 59.0, 58.9, 90.0sec
this - 87.2, 58.1, 57.8, 57.5, 88.8sec
(the first ones are presumably slower because of compile time; the last ones were done with more background load), i.e. if anything slightly faster.

3918,6512,Bugfix: spaces in temp path prevents cudnn init,deltaz0,"When initializing theano with cudnn, `_try_compile_tmp` is eventually run to verify compiling a test program with gcc. This function requests a temporary path for the test program from the `mkstemp` function of tempfile.py. Rarely, this can return a path that has spaces in it. If this happens, gcc cannot parse it correctly and throws an error, which will look something like:

```
RuntimeError: You enabled cuDNN, but we aren't able to use it: cannot compile with cuDNN. We got this error:
g++.exe: error: c:\\program: No such file or directory
```

The proposed change encloses the temp path in quotes, allowing gcc to parse it even if it contains spaces.

For an example case: I was running python through an ssh client which accesses the home directory through a symlink in C:\\Program Files\\openssh\\. `mkstemp` defaulted to the working directory (because I didn't have any of the default directories such as C:\\temp) and returned the path including the space in ""Program Files"", which crashed gcc.",,,,2017-11-17 04:38:33,2017-11-20 19:08:33,theano/gof/cmodule.py,bdfaafac27d98a3f079344419282ea4359b94438 f467a0102103a9ebfe0f80eded42f1ae10dc501d,"nouiz referenced 2017-11-20 19:08:33,nouiz merged 2017-11-20 19:08:33,nouiz closed 2017-11-20 19:08:33",deltaz0 nouiz,2,True

3925,6530,Fix GPU initialization checking on buildbot.,notoraptor,"In the Windows buildbot, we test GPU initialization with `""import theano.gpuarray; theano.gpuarray.use('%DEVICE%')""`, But we set `THEANO_FLAGS=init_gpu_device=cuda` before (see top of file), thus `import theano.gpuarray` will automatically initialize the GPU, then the second instruction (`theano.gpuarray.use(%DEVICE%)`) will force a second initialization, that is forbidden by the @abergeron 's PR (first initialization will set OS env var `THEANO_GPU_IS_ALREADY_ACTIVE`, and second initialization will fail because that OS env var will be already set).

We must either: find a better way to distinguish mutiple initalization accross different processes vs multiiple initialization inside the same process, or update jenkins scripts to prevent multiple initialization inside the same process (I guess that case is not desired, neither). I choose to update the jenskins script for Windows buildbot.

PS: I guess some other Jenkins scripts should fail too, as they used the same strategy, but I did not yet change them.

4003,6749,MAINT: Be compatible with numpy 1.17 and scipy 1.3,rebecca-palmer,"Fixes #6715 and most of #6719 (= [Debian 955471](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=955471)).  Includes and supersedes #6721.

Tested (affected tests, not a full run) in:
- Debian unstable (Python 3.8, numpy 1.17, scipy 1.3)
- Debian stable (Python 3.7, numpy 1.16, scipy 1.1)

ClipTester: As noted in #6715, numpy changed its behaviour when min > max, but theano didn't.  Removed the test of this case, but not warning for it because clip is a scalar op and we don't want a warning for every entry of a large matrix.

random test_vector_args (both instances): numpy, and hence theano, now accepts size=(1,) even if low/high aren't scalars.  Removed test cases that assume it doesn't.

sparse (both instances): Only a problem with the test setup - the method it used to use for producing a non-index-sorted test matrix now produces an index-sorted matrix.  Switched to a different setup method.

TestComputeTestValue: As previously noted, test was looking at the wrong stack level.  Switched to checking all stack levels to be compatible with both versions.

sort (both instances): numpy now enforces that sort axes are of integer type, not just integer value.  Added a check for integer value then cast to int.

4006,6759,Fix collections warnings,1fish2,"Fixes the scary deprecation warnings that clients see, as mentioned in #6755, and some of the other warnings in the code.

* The `compat/__init__.py` DeprecationWarning about 'collections' was already fixed in 1b9804b65ecd008cfb424752e65aced92b63ff92, not yet on PyPI.
* The `misc/frozendict.py` DeprecationWarning about 'collections' just needed to add `'Callable'` to `__all__` in that module.

For a speedy way to test this fix, make a pyenv virtualenv, use this `requirements.txt` file (my best guess on it) to install pips, and run a limited nose test:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv virtualenvwrapper virtualenv-clone wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt && pyenv rehash
bin/theano-nose theano/tests/test_config.py
```

I ran the limited and the full `bin/theano-nose` in Python 2.7.18, 3.8.5, and 3.9.0b5. (I tried to run it in Python 3.10-dev but `pip install numpy` failed.) The full test can take 1.5 - 3 hours.
